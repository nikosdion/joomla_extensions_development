  <title>Components</title>

  <para>The Joomla component is arguably the most important extension type. It's not just the sheer fact that it is an
  application inside an application, letting us create custom experiences otherwise nearly impossible with just core
  code, it is also that Joomla embraces the need for this kind of custom experiences and has heavily invested in making
  component development relatively easy. This is in stark contrast with WordPress where your experience is far and
  foremost defined by its core code, custom experiences outside custom content types are actively discouraged and there
  is no sensible API for creating an equivalent extension type without a lot of reinventing the wheel, bending over
  backwards and judicious application of the Dark Arts.</para>

    <title>The Joomla MVC: an introduction</title>

    <para>Joomla came with a strong legacy of modular architecture in version 1.0, when it was a little more than a fork
    of and improvement upon Mambo 4, its predecessor. Joomla 1.5 introduced extension developers to the concept of <link
    xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller">MVC</link> (Model-View-Controller) where each
    component has defined and logical structure, separating business logic from presentation. Joomla 4 improves upon
    this legacy, by further polishing the MVC and embracing concepts introduced to the PHP developer's arsenal over the
    last decade and a half.</para>

    <para>Before delving into improvements and changes in Joomla 4 I think a little Joomla MVC refresher is in order.
    This is especially useful if you are used to the MVC definition from a college Computer Science class or have used
    real MVC in other programming languages or even PHP frameworks (e.g. in Laravel the typical Model is Eloquent which
    works completely differently, the View is your Blade files and the Controller is more of a collection of middleware
    rather than a single class — it's still MVC but a different dialect in the same way Spanish, Italian and French are
    all Romance languages).</para>

    <para>Joomla follows the MVC model typically called “skinny controller - fat model”. This puts most of the business
    logic into the Model and keeps the Controller a relatively nimble affair. Further to that, Joomla also uses another
    class called a Table to abstract our interaction with the persistence layer objects (that's a fancy, pretentious way
    of saying “database table”). So, it's really an MVCT approach.</para>

    <para>But what are these Controllers, Models and Views anyway?</para>

    <para>The Controller consists of one or more <emphasis>tasks</emphasis> implemented as public methods. Each one of
    them tells the controller to <emphasis>do</emphasis> something. For example display an article, publish or unpublish
    an article, delete an article, log in the user, check the Multi-factor Authentication provided by the user, create a
    user data deletion request and so on and so forth. Controllers are orchestrators; they know what work needs to be
    done but they do not do it themselves. The Controller handles requests: it reads the user input and decides what
    needs to happen next which is invariably one of two things. For simple tasks with no output like publishing an
    article, deleting an article, logging in a user etc it will get the Model, tell it what to do and then issue a
    redirection to a different page, possibly setting a (very short!) message to show to the user. Most of the time it
    will need to create a document, e.g. an HTML page, a JSON document, an RSS feed etc. In this case it will get the
    appropriate View, push the Model to it and ask it to render itself. It then takes the rendered document and echoes
    it; Joomla will intercept that and decide what to do with the document effectively returned by the Controller. If an
    error occurred the Controller will catch it and decide what to do with it: swallow it or push it up the stack so
    that it ends up becoming an error page for the user.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Note that unlike the normative Controller of the MVC pattern the Joomla component's Controller DOES
    NOT normally push data to the Model. Yes, this is a violation of the separation of concerns. However, addressing
    that would be a massive backwards compatibility break which would necessitate the rethinking and rewriting of all
    Joomla components, core and third party. As a result we are unlikely to ever see this changing.</emphasis></para>

    <para>The Model is the workhorse of the component. It has the <emphasis>business logic</emphasis>, i.e. it knows how
    to get things done. In most cases it is a data-aware model which means that it knows how to get stuff from the
    database, put stuff back to the database and perform other auxiliary functions with the database data. It does NOT
    handle any presentation logic, i.e. it will NOT output any HTML. It returns raw data whenever it is asked to.
    Therefore you can use a Model in any context: inside the component, in a CLI script, in the API application (which
    only handles and returns JSON data), a Scheduled Task, a module, a plugin, even a template (though that would be a
    bit of an architectural violation; I won't judge you harshly if you do that because you're on a deadline and/or a
    shoestring budget).</para>

    <para><emphasis>Note that unlike the normative Model of the MVC pattern the Joomla component's Model will seek data
    from the user session and if it's not found there it will try to get it from the request. This makes it a pain in
    the posterior to use outside the frontend, backend and API applications, e.g. in a CLI application. Yes, there's a
    trick to that (and probably a section I will have to write at some point): set its state manually and it will no
    longer try to get data from the request.</emphasis></para>

    <para>As I said, Joomla also has a Table class which, architecturally speaking, is somewhere between a Model and a
    Persistence Layer. But we're not CS majors, we're Joomla extension developers. What we need to know is that the
    Table class is an abstraction which represents exactly one record of a database table. Table classes only exist in
    the backend of your component but can be used anywhere. They are used either inside a Model or directly on their
    own.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Tables are used by Models but not when returning multiple rows. When you run getItems on a ListModel
    you get an array of stdClass objects. This sounds odd at first but it makes sense; Models can join multiple tables
    and return embellished data in lists. For example, you may not just get a user ID but also the user's name and email
    address as separate fields. In most (but not all!) cases you could instantiate a Table object and call its bind()
    method with one of the aforementioned stdClass objects as its argument to get a Table object representation of your
    data. Just remember in this case that instantiating a Table object is computationally expensive as it needs to parse
    the database table's column definitions. Create an instance of the Table object. Then clone it for each row you are
    processing and bind the data to the Table object's clone. When processing a few dozen or more rows it can save you
    hundreds of milliseconds of page load time.</emphasis></para>

    <para>Then, we have Views. Now, this is the biggest departure of the normative MVC pattern. In Computer Science the
    View only renders information in a suitable way for the user to understand. A Joomla component's View is actually
    part controller and part ViewModel. Which means that Joomla's MVC is neither MVC nor MVVM, it's its own thing. But,
    as we said before, we are not CS majors, we are Joomla extension developers. So let's see what our View does.</para>

    <para>Our View gets data from the Model. It does a bit of error checking to make sure nothing is amiss — if it is,
    it will show an appropriate error state be it the new in Joomla 4 Empty State (guiding the user to please create
    some data when we have nothing to show them) or an error page if something has gone so bad we don't know what to do.
    It is also responsible for setting up the page metadata (frontend) or the page's Title and Toolbar (backend) which
    is View-related stuff in the same way that making coffee is related to hosting an in-person meeting: not really your
    job but people would be really upset if nobody did it.</para>

    <para>In the end, the View renders the information in an appropriate format for the user — which is what a View is
    really supposed to do if it wants to be called a View! For HTML pages it calls one or more View Template files to
    render some HTML. For other view types such as JSON, Raw, XML, Feed and so on a view template file may be used but
    it's neither necessary nor does it always make sense. If you're returning a JSON document or a CSV it makes far more
    sense to construct it directly in your View code and return it than going through an unnecessary round-trip through
    a view template file.</para>

    <para>Finally, we need to talk about the View Template files. These are the real View of the MVC pattern: they
    convert the raw data we got from our Model to the HTML which will be displayed to the user. Why not have the View
    return the HTML directly? Well, we <emphasis>could</emphasis> but we'd have two problems. First, the View itself is
    also part Controller and part ViewModel therefore we'd have an issue with the separation of concerns, mixing
    business logic with presentation logic (bad idea; we are using MVC to avoid this bad practice). Second, Joomla's
    raw, unadulterated power comes from the fact that our end users can <emphasis>override</emphasis> View Templates in
    their sites, thereby changing the presentation of our component in ways we can neither think of nor support in any
    meaningful way across our entire user base.</para>

    <para>This is the overview of Joomla's MVC and you'll be happy to know that it has not actually changed ever since
    Joomla 1.5. Some implementation details have changed but the core concepts — the good, the bad and the ugly parts
    alike — have remained unchanged in Joomla 4. In other words, if you already have a perfectly serviceable component
    written for Joomla 3 you <emphasis>can</emphasis> migrate it to Joomla 4. It's not a different language (like
    Italian to Spanish), it's a different <emphasis>dialect</emphasis>. Yes, you'll need to learn the vernacular of the
    new dialect but it's much, much easier than learning a new language. I am saying that as someone who had to learn
    three foreign (human) languages and more programming languages than I care to list.</para>

  <section xml:id="com-j3-vs-j4-mvc">
    <title>Joomla 3 MVC vs Joomla 4 MVC</title>

    <para>As we already said, the basic functionality of Joomla's MVC has remained the same throughout Joomla 3 and 4.
    If you know how to make a Joomla 3 component you know most of what you need to make a Joomla 4 component. The
    differences are a few minor, but salient, points.</para>

    <para><link linkend="com-namespaces"><emphasis role="bold">Namespaces</emphasis></link>. All native Joomla 4
    components use <link xlink:href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php">PHP namespaces</link> for
    their PHP code. This is a simple change in naming classes for models, views and controllers. For example, instead of
    your frontend model being called <code>ExampleModelItem</code> it will now be the class <code>ItemModel</code> in
    the namespace <classname>\Acme\Component\Example\Site\Model</classname>. The first part of the namespace in this
    example, <code>\Acme\Component\Example</code>, is the same for the whole component. This component namespace prefix
    consists of 3 parts:<programlisting>\<replaceable>My</replaceable>\Component\<replaceable>ComponentName</replaceable></programlisting></para>

    <para>for instance (as often used throughout this book):<programlisting>\Acme\Component\Example</programlisting>The
    3 parts of a component namespace prefix:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><code><emphasis role="bold">\<replaceable>My</replaceable></emphasis></code> vendor namespace prefix: a
        valid PHP namespace, unique for you, your company or your project. A valid vendor namespace prefix can for
        instance be <classname>\Acme</classname>. A vendor namespace prefix can also have sub-namespaces, for instance:
        <classname>\Acme\Support\Tools</classname>. You are free to choose your own vendor namespace, however:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The vendor namespace should not start with <classname>\Joomla</classname>, because component
            namespaces starting withIn <classname>\Joomla</classname> are reserved for core components.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The vendor namespace should not contain a sub-namespace starting with
            <classname>\Component</classname>. It is a reserved sub-namespace, that should only be used immediately
            AFTER the vendor namespace prefix in a component namespace.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><code><emphasis role="bold">\Component</emphasis></code> sub-namespace: literally "\Component", with a
        capital C. You should use the <code>\Component</code> sub-namespace in the component namespace only once: AFTER
        the vendor namespace and BEFORE the sub-namespace with the component name.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><code><emphasis role="bold">\<replaceable>ComponentName</replaceable></emphasis></code> sub-namespace: a
        valid component name for Joomla as is used in com_componentname. In the namespace-part you can use camel case;
        in com_componentname only lowercase is used. A valid component name would for instance be
        <classname>Example</classname> in the namespace <classname>Acme\Component\Example</classname> for component
        <code>com_example</code>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Namespaces are originally meant to avoid name collisions for classes, functions and constants, while
    conveniently using shorter names to identify those classes, functions and constants. In Joomla 3 many frontend and
    backend classes had the same name, like for instance <classname>ContentModelArticle</classname>, and those frontend
    and backend classes couldn't be used together. Namespaces to the rescue: the frontend class, including its
    namespace, is now called <classname>\Joomla\Component\Content\Site\Model\ArticleModel</classname> and the backend
    class <classname>\Joomla\Component\Content\Administrator\Model\ArticleModel</classname>.</para>

    <para>In the PHP-world there is a standard for autoloading, which uses namespaces: <link
    xlink:href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/">PSR4</link>. A namespace prefix is mapped to a path in the
    filesystem. Any sub-namespaces that are under the mapped namespace are one-on-one mapped to subdirectories with the
    same names. For instance the namespace <classname>\Joomla\Component\Content\Administrator</classname> is mapped to
    <filename>/administrator/components/com_content/src</filename>. The class
    <classname>\Joomla\Component\Content\Administrator\Model\ArticleModel</classname> is then found in the subdirectory
    <filename>/Model</filename> of <filename>/administrator/components/com_content/src</filename>. Any code with a
    namespace that adheres to PSR4 can automatically be autoloaded. In Joomla the mapping is cached in the
    <filename>administrator/cache/autoload_psr4.php</filename> file.</para>

    <para>Because of the PSR4 autoloading, the namespace of your custom component can be used to locate any file in your
    component from elsewhere in Joomla. For example, to find the code files for custom form fields you may need in your
    component. The way to tell Joomla which namespace to use for custom form fields is with the
    <code>addfieldprefix</code> attribute in an XML form. This attribute of a fieldset (and method of
    <classname>Joomla\CMS\Form\FormHelper</classname>) is new since Joomla 3.8 and can be used to add a namespace for
    your custom fields, so they can be found with PSR4 autoloading, instead of directly providing a path as was done
    with the <code>addfieldpath</code> attribute.</para>

    <para><link linkend="com-services"><emphasis role="bold">Service provider</emphasis></link>. All Joomla components
    are passed a Dependency Injection Container (DIC) which is, in fact, a Service Locator. This even applies to
    components written with the Joomla 3 MVC as we'll see in <link linkend="com-lifetime">the lifetime of a
    component</link>. You can register services specific to your component in your service locator. At the very least,
    Joomla expects you to set up the <link linkend="com-extension">extension class</link> of your component.
    Unfortunately, even simple components need to have a service provider as there is no convention-over-configuration
    in Joomla 4's component DIC.</para>

    <para><link linkend="com-extension"><emphasis role="bold">Extension class</emphasis></link>. The extension class
    <emphasis>replaces</emphasis> the entry point file (e.g.
    <filename>administrator/components/com_example/example.php</filename>) you had in Joomla 3 MVC. All components
    written with the Joomla 4 MVC have an extension class which extends from
    <code>Joomla\CMS\Extension\MVCComponent</code>. It is used to register special services used when working with your
    component such as the <code>MVCFactory</code> service (responsible for creating model, view and controller object
    instances), an <link linkend="com-html">HTML helper service</link> which extends Joomla's HTMLHelper, a <link
    linkend="com-router">Router service</link> for frontend search engine friendly (SEF) URL routing, and a <link
    linkend="com-categories">Category service</link> if your component uses core Categories. It also returns your
    component's <link linkend="com-dispatcher">Dispatcher</link> which is where the execution of your component starts.
    For very simple components you can even use the core MVCComponent class as your extension class, without
    sub-classing. See, for example, what the core <code>com_actionlogs</code> component does.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold"><link linkend="com-dispatcher">Dispatcher</link> instead of a front
    controller</emphasis>. In the Joomla 3 MVC paradigm you had a <filename>controller.php</filename> file in the root
    of your component's directory structure. This was a front-controller, supposed to figure out which controller to use
    to handle the specified view and task in the request. This was a bit gimmicky and error-prone, especially if you had
    components capable of displaying more than one discrete types of information, e.g. a downloads repository would be
    able to display categories, releases in a category and files in a release which made for three discrete content
    types which had to be handled by the same front controller. The new Dispatcher does the same job, it works without
    sub-classing it for most simple extensions and benefits greatly the more complex extensions which need more involved
    request processing.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold"><link linkend="com-html">HTML helper</link> is a service</emphasis>. If you had ever
    registered an HTMLHelper class with static calls this is no longer the recommended method. If you need an HTML
    helper for your extension you need to register it through the extension class and its methods are no longer static.
    Since it's a real object instantiated by the extension object it has access to the component's DIC, therefore to any
    service you registered in your service provider or you were given by Joomla in the DIC. This makes helpers testable
    and means that they can access custom services (e.g. a shipping cost calculation service if you are writing an
    e-commerce component) without trying to contort your code.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">New format for </emphasis><link linkend="com-router"><emphasis
    role="bold">Router</emphasis></link>. Joomla 4 comes with a new Router which is instantiated through a service. The
    new component router superclass allows you to write efficient routers without a lot of boilerplate, duplicated and
    convoluted code.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="com-lifetime">
    <title>The lifetime of a component</title>

    <para>In the previous section we talked about the new concepts in the Joomla 4 MVC but it's really hard to
    understand how they all work together. It's best if we talk about the lifetime of a component, i.e. what happens
    when you try to access a Joomla URL in the form <uri>index.php?option=com_example&amp;view=foo</uri>.</para>

    <para>The lifetime of our component starts in the application object (<code>SiteApplication</code>,
    <code>AdministratorApplication</code> or <code>ApiApplication</code>), namely its <code>dispatch()</code> method.
    All these methods do some initialisation and call <code>Joomla\CMS\Component::renderComponent()</code>. This method
    runs this line where things get interesting for our component:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">$app-&gt;bootComponent($option)-&gt;getDispatcher($app)-&gt;dispatch();</programlisting>

    <para>Let's rewrite it so it's more readable:</para>

    <para><programlisting language="php">$componentExtension = $app-&gt;bootComponent($option)
            $componentDispatcher = $componentExtension-&gt;getDispatcher($app)
            $componentDispatcher-&gt;dispatch();</programlisting>What Joomla does is ask the application object to
    <emphasis>somehow</emphasis> get a component extension object — even if it is a legacy component using the Joomla 3
    MVC. Then it asks the component extension object to get it the component's Dispatcher object. Finally, it tells the
    component's Dispatcher to dispatch (execute) the component.</para>

    <para>These three steps are crucial to understanding the difference between legacy Joomla 3 MVC components, modern
    Joomla 4 MVC components and how Joomla 4 makes them all work.</para>

    <section xml:id="com-lifetime-booting">
      <title>Booting the component</title>

      <para>The <code>bootComponent</code> method is implemented by
      <classname>Joomla\CMS\Extension\ExtensionManagerTrait</classname>. The first thing it does, by calling its
      <code>loadExtension</code> method, is to figure out if this is a Joomla 4 MVC or Joomla 3 MVC component. It does
      that by looking for the <filename>services/provider.php</filename> file under the component's root. As you may
      have guessed this is our component's <link linkend="com-services">service provider</link> and the reason why all
      Joomla 4 MVC components, even the simplest ones for which we could infer their service provider, really do need to
      have a service provider file.</para>

      <para>If the file exists it's loaded and its services are registered into the copy of the Joomla DIC which is used
      as our component's DIC.</para>

      <note>
        <para>This means that our component only sees a frozen in time copy of the global application services. You
        cannot register any services in the component's DIC and expect them to be available in the global
        application.</para>
      </note>

      <para>If the file does not exist, Joomla creates an instance of the
      <classname>Joomla\CMS\Extension\LegacyComponent</classname>. As you can see, this extension object uses a legacy
      MVC factory object which "speaks" the Joomla 3 non-namespaced MVC class names and a legacy component dispatcher
      which looks for the <filename>componentName.php</filename> (in our example: <filename>example.php</filename>)
      component entry point file and loads it. This is exactly how Joomla 4 can render components using Joomla 3
      MVC.</para>

      <para>The rest of this section will talk about a Joomla 4 MVC component.</para>

      <para>Finally, Joomla returns <link linkend="com-extension">the component's extension object</link> as the result
      of the <code>bootComponent</code> method.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>You can call <code>\Joomla\CMS\Factory::getApplication()-&gt;bootComponent('com_example')</code> to get
        the <code>com_example</code> component's extension object anytime, anywhere — <emphasis role="bold">including in
        modules and plugins</emphasis>. If you subclass the <code>Joomla\CMS\Extension\MVCExtension</code> class in your
        own component you can create your own methods to return <emphasis>ANY OBJECT KNOWN TO THE COMPONENT AND ITS
        CONTAINER</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>This is of enormous importance.</para>

        <para>You can instantiate any MVC class of the component. You have access to your HTML helper, categories
        service and router service. You can get an instance of any of the custom services you created in your component.
        All of that WITHOUT any static helpers in your extension, WITHOUT worrying that something might break if you
        call your code outside your component. Your Models can provide a public API for third party developers
        communicating with your component.</para>

        <para>Joomla core components already do that. For example, you can get the backend
        <classname>ArticleModel</classname> of <code>com_content</code> in a frontend component or plugin to create a
        new Joomla article <emphasis>the right way</emphasis>:</para>

        <programlisting language="php">$articleModel = \Joomla\CMS\Factory::getApplication()
                    -&gt;bootComponent('com_content')
                    -&gt;getMVCFactory()
                    -&gt;createModel('Article', 'Administrator');</programlisting>
      </tip>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-lifetime-dispatcher">
      <title>Getting the Dispatcher</title>

      <para>The extension object is responsible for returning a number of interesting objects through its methods. These
      objects are meant to be used for interacting with the component. One of these is <code>getDispatcher</code> which
      lets us retrieve the component's <link linkend="com-dispatcher">Dispatcher</link> object.</para>

      <para>Your extension can have a custom dispatcher class,
      <classname>\<replaceable>My</replaceable>\Component\<replaceable>Example</replaceable>\Dispatcher\Dispatcher</classname>,
      where <classname>\<replaceable>My</replaceable>\Component\<replaceable>Example</replaceable></classname> is your
      component's prefix. If this class exists, an object instance of it is returned.</para>

      <para>If your extension does not have a dispatcher an instance of the default
      <classname>Joomla\CMS\Dispatcher\ComponentDispatcher</classname> (site and administrator applications) or
      <classname>Joomla\CMS\Dispatcher\ApiDispatcher</classname> (API application) will be created and returned
      instead.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-lifetime-dispatching">
      <title>Dispatching the component</title>

      <para>The dispatcher object has a <code>dispatch()</code> method. This method looks in the request data to figure
      out which controller it needs to instantiate and which task it should execute on it. The controller object is
      instantiated through your component's <classname>MVCFactory</classname> service and its <code>execute</code> and
      <code>redirect</code> methods are called on it. So, yes, this is basically what your old Joomla 3 MVC
      <filename>controller.php</filename> file was doing.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>Having a custom dispatcher means that you can manipulate the <emphasis>controller and task</emphasis>
        based on other request variables.</para>

        <para>This is very important when your component is accessed <emphasis>outside of a Joomla menu item (no Itemid
        in the request variables)</emphasis>. In this case Joomla always uses the default (Home) menu item for the
        current language. This means that you may be getting a <uri>controller</uri>, <uri>view</uri> or <uri>task</uri>
        request variable — as well as other variables which might mess with your component, like <uri>id</uri> — from
        the Home menu item.</para>

        <para>Your Dispatcher is responsible for figuring out if this is the case and fix the input variables to prevent
        weird bugs / showing the wrong page of your component when it's accessed without a menu item id, e.g. a URL like
        <uri>/component/example?view=foobar</uri>. This is something which has happened a lot when I converted my own
        extensions to Joomla 4, including LoginGuard (the extension contributed as Joomla's Multi-factor Authentication
        feature in Joomla 4.2).</para>

  <section xml:id="com-services">
    <title>Service provider</title>

    <para>As discussed in the previous section, the service provider file is mandatory for Joomla 4 MVC components and
    lives in the component's <filename>services</filename> folder and always named
    <filename>provider.php</filename>.</para>

    <para>The absolutely minimal minimal service provider file looks like the following:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">&lt;?php
defined('_JEXEC') || die;

use Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Extension\ExampleComponent;
use Joomla\CMS\Dispatcher\ComponentDispatcherFactoryInterface;
use Joomla\CMS\Extension\ComponentInterface;
use Joomla\CMS\Extension\Service\Provider\MVCFactory;
use Joomla\CMS\MVC\Factory\MVCFactoryInterface;
use Joomla\DI\Container;
use Joomla\DI\ServiceProviderInterface;

return new class implements ServiceProviderInterface {
  public function register(Container $container)
  {
    // PART 1: Register service providers to the component's container
    $container-&gt;registerServiceProvider(new MVCFactory('Acme\\Example'));

    // PART 2: Instantiate and set up your extension object
    $container-&gt;set(
      ComponentInterface::class,
      function (Container $container) {
        /**
         * PART 2.a: Instantiate the extension object
         *
         * If you do not have a custom extension class use \Joomla\CMS\Extension\MVCComponent instead.
         */
        $component = new \Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Extension\ExampleComponent(
          $container-&gt;get(ComponentDispatcherFactoryInterface::class)
        );

        // PART 2.b: Set up the extension object
        $component-&gt;setMVCFactory($container-&gt;get(MVCFactoryInterface::class));

        // PART 2.c: return the extension object
        return $component;
      }
    );
  }
};
        </programlisting>

    <para>As you can see the service provider returns an <link
    xlink:href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.anonymous.php">anonymous PHP class</link> which implements
    the <code>Joomla\DI\ServiceProviderInterface</code>. That's the standard way to extend Joomla's DIC. Remember, as we
    learned in <link linkend="com-lifetime">the lifetime of a component</link>, Joomla creates a
    <emphasis>copy</emphasis> of its DIC and uses it as our component's own DIC. The service providers we set up in our
    component stay with our component, they do not leak out to the global application scope (the global Joomla DIC you
    get through the <code>Joomla\CMS\Factory::getContainer()</code> static method).</para>

    <para>Part 1 of that file lets us register service providers to our component's DIC. At the bare minimum we need to
    register a <code>Joomla\CMS\Extension\Service\Provider\MVCFactory</code> provider. This returns an object
    implementing <code>Joomla\CMS\MVC\Factory\MVCFactoryInterface</code> which is used by our component's code (and
    Joomla's core code) to get the MVC objects of our component (Controllers, Models, Views, Tables). If we want to use
    more core Joomla features with our component we may have to register more service providers as we'll see in the
    <link linkend="com-extension">Extension class</link> section and the rest of the sections of this chapter.</para>

    <para>Part 2 sets up a service provider returning an object implementing the
    <code>Joomla\CMS\Extension\ComponentInterface</code>, i.e. our component's extension object.</para>

    <para>Part 2.a is where we create an instance of our <link linkend="com-extension">extension class</link>. If you
    have a dead simple component which does not use a custom extension class you can use Joomla's built-in
    <code>\Joomla\CMS\Extension\MVCComponent</code> class instead. Most components will need a custom extension class so
    we instantiate it here.</para>

    <para>Part 2.b is where we set up the extension object we created in Part 2.a. Remember when I told you that <link
    linkend="concepts-container">Joomla's DIC is not really a Dependency Injection Container</link> but more of a
    Service Locator? Because of that fact, when we create the extension object it does not know of any service objects
    it needs to use. Therefore we have to push them manually.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Sidebar: In my opinion, the three biggest shortcomings of the Joomla 4 MVC are the lack of
    convention over configuration, the lack of abstracted configuration and the lack of a real Dependency Injection
    container. These three shortcomings are, respectively, why we need to have a service provider file, why we need Part
    1 and Part 2.b and why we need Part 2.a. Most other PHP frameworks have already solved these shortcomings. This
    means that any complaints that Joomla is moving to a very abstracted approach just to compete with other PHP
    frameworks are entirely unfounded; Joomla's architecture is still a good 10 or so years behind the PHP state of the
    art. This is not a bad thing! Too much abstraction may be a good thing for experienced, hardcore developers like
    yours truly but not necessarily the easiest thing to get your head around if you're a newcomer to Joomla or PHP in
    general.</emphasis></para>

    <para>Finally, we have Part 3 where we return the configured extension object, necessary for our custom service
    provider to <emphasis>actually work</emphasis>.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>You may be tempted to think that the service provider is only ever called when Joomla is about to render
      your component. <emphasis role="bold">This is not the case</emphasis>. Joomla will load a component's service
      provider any time it needs to interact with any of its services including the Router, or because another extension
      (such as a plugin, or module) wants to get access to your component's Models or some other service or
      object.</para>

      <para>Just because your service provider's code is running DOES NOT mean you are about to render an HTML page with
      your component, it DOES NOT mean that you necessarily have access to the JPATH_COMPONENT and
      JPATH_COMPONENT_ADMINISTRATOR constants and absolutely DOES NOT mean that you should ever,
      <emphasis>ever</emphasis>, try to push CSS, JavaScript or run any other code which assumes that Joomla is in an
      HTML output state.</para>

      <para>If you have such code (which is generally a bad idea) you should run it in your component's <link
      linkend="com-dispatcher">Dispatcher</link> and only after checking that you are indeed running in an HTML
      application (check the type of the object returned from calling
      <code>\Joomla\CMS\Factory::getApplication()-&gt;getDocument()</code>).</para>
    </warning>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="com-extension">
    <title>Extension class</title>

    <para>As we saw earlier in <link linkend="com-lifetime">the lifetime of a component</link>, the Extension class of a
    component is <emphasis>sort of</emphasis> a service locator for our component. Joomla checks if that objects
    implements a PHP Interface it knows about and uses the service communicated via the Interface implementation
    (typically one of the corresponding PHP Traits provided by Joomla) to do something useful, e.g. register an
    HTMLHelper helper, integrate with Tags, create SEF URLs by using a Router and so on and so forth.</para>

    <para>If your component does not make use of any of these features you do not need to create a custom extension
    class for your component. Joomla gives you the perfectly serviceable <code>Joomla\CMS\Extension\MVCComponent</code>
    class which implements a minimal Joomla 4 component: it can run because it returns a Dispatcher and it can create
    MVC objects using the Joomla 4 MVC because it returns an MVCFactory object. This is enough for a component which
    only runs in the backend or runs in both the frontend and the backend but has no way of letting Joomla create SEF
    URLs for it. You may think this is useless but I'd contest you're not thinking simple enough. Case in point, some
    core Joomla components doing exactly that. For example the <code>com_actionlogs</code> component which only has a
    backend user interface.</para>

    <para>That said, there wouldn't be much to write if all or even most components didn't need a custom extension
    class. You see, most components need one or more of the following features. I am documenting the features I
    discovered that need customisations in the extension class and give you an overview of the required changes in your
    component's code to make them work.</para>

    <section xml:id="com-extension-naming">
      <title>Naming your extension class</title>

      <para>There are no hard rules for naming your component's extension class. That said, to help anyone reading your
      code — including yourself six or so months later — retain a modicum of their sanity it is advisable to use the
      convention
      <code>\<replaceable>My</replaceable>\Component\<replaceable>ComponentName</replaceable>\Administrator\Extension\<replaceable>ComponentName</replaceable>+Component</code>
      where:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><code>\<replaceable>My</replaceable>\Component\<replaceable>ComponentName</replaceable></code> is the
          namespace prefix of your component, for instance <classname>\Acme\Component\Example</classname></para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><code><replaceable>ComponentName</replaceable></code> is the name of your component without the
          <code>com_</code> prefix, with the first letter in uppercase, for instance <code>Example</code> for component
          <code>com_example</code></para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><code>Component</code> is the literal "Component". With
          <code><replaceable>ComponentName</replaceable>+Component</code> we mean a concatenation of the component name
          and the literal string "Component", for instance <code>ExampleComponent</code> for component
          <code>com_example</code></para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>For example, if you have a component named <code>com_example</code> with the namespace prefix
      <classname>\Acme\Component\Example</classname> your extension class should be
      <classname>\Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Extension\ExampleComponent</classname> and placed in the file
      <filename>administrator/components/com_example/src/Extension/ExampleComponent.php</filename>.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-extension-provider">
      <title>Using your extension class in the service provider</title>

      <para>As you remember from the service provider section, in Part 2.a you need to instantiate the extension class.
      These lines would look like this:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$component = new \Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Extension\ExampleComponent(
  $container-&gt;get(ComponentDispatcherFactoryInterface::class)
);</programlisting>

      <para>Simple, isn't it?</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-extension-outside-com">
      <title>Using your extension class from outside the component</title>

      <para>Now we are finally able to answer the question which you had in mind coming to this section: why in the name
      of Cthulu do I have to have an extension class and what does it accomplish beyond adding yet another layer of
      complexity to my extension writing problems?</para>

      <para>For that, let's consider this. Let's say we have a news site and we are building a system plugin which
      checks every day for newly published articles, auto-generating a daily summary blog post using the intro text of
      these articles and some preset template (maybe even some judicious use of a GPT-3–based AI). This plugin would
      need to publish an article. You could of course just instantiate the <code>ArticleTable</code> class of
      <code>com_content</code> directly to do that but this would not run any content plugins or create the right
      entries in the #__assets table, breaking your site. You need to use the com_content Article backend model of
      <code>com_content</code>.</para>

      <para>Back in the Joomla 3 days you would do that by directly instantiating the <code>ContentModelArticle</code>
      class. Okay, first problem: Joomla didn't know where to find it so you have to <code>require_once()</code> the
      file. Second problem: what if that model changes over time and has dependencies to other classes you have failed
      to require the files of? Believe me, I've been there, done that and it was about as enjoyable as using a rusty
      fork to pull my eyes out of their sockets.</para>

      <para>In Joomla 4 you don't have to care about the class autoloading, but the <code>ArticleModel</code> will
      actually need access to other services provided by the <code>com_content</code> component for things like tagging,
      custom fields and workflows. If you try to instantiate the model class directly you will get a lot of errors as
      well. So, who are you gonna call? No, not Ghostbusters; they are Hollywood fiction. You're gonna call the very
      real and very useful <code>bootComponent</code> method of the application!</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$contentExtension = \Joomla\CMS\Factory::getApplication()
  -&gt;bootComponent('com_content');
$articleModel = $contentExtension
  -&gt;getMVCFactory()
  -&gt;createModel('Article', 'Administrator');</programlisting>

      <para>The first two lines told Joomla to “boot” the <code>com_content</code> component, returning its
      <emphasis>extension object</emphasis>. Now we have have access to all services known to this object through its
      various getters (method whose name start with <code>get</code>).</para>

      <para>This works for any component, anywhere, anytime. You can be in the frontend, backend, API application or CLI
      application or in an execution context you don't care to know about in a Scheduled Tasks plugin. No problem! You
      can boot any components — yours, core, or third party — to get its extension object and Bob's your uncle.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-extension-dic-proxy">
      <title>Getting access to the component's DIC anytime, anywhere</title>

      <para>I see that some of you are <emphasis>still</emphasis> not convinced that the extension object is a cool
      concept.</para>

      <para>Remember when I told you that the Joomla DIC — therefore the component's DIC which is a customised copy of
      it — is not a real Dependency Injection Container but a Service Locator and lamented the fact that you cannot get
      a reference to it from anywhere in your component, unlike modern PHP frameworks like Laravel?</para>

      <para>Well, it turns out that you can get access to your component's DIC anywhere, anytime. You just need to add
      the following handy code to your extension's class:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">protected static $dic;

public function boot(ContainerInterface $container)
{
  self::$dic = $container;
}

public static function getContainer()
{
  if (empty(self::$dic))
  {
    Factory::getApplication()
      -&gt;bootComponent('com_example');
  }

  return self::$dic;
}
            </programlisting>

      <para>This code is very simple. We declare a protected static variable holding our component's DIC. This is
      initialised by the boot method which is called whenever the component is booted. The static method getContainer
      returns the component's DIC; if the DIC was undefined at this point it boots the component first.</para>

      <para>So now you can simply do:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$exampleDIC = \Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Extension\ExampleComponent::getContainer();</programlisting>

      <para>The component's DIC gives you access to all of the application's services and your component's service.
      Using the MVCFactory to get an MVC object you can be sure that it will work as intended.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="com-dispatcher">
    <title>Dispatcher</title>

    <para>As we said <link linkend="com-j3-vs-j4-mvc">when comparing the Joomla 3 to the Joomla 4 MVC</link>, the
    Dispatcher takes the place of the front controller (<filename>controller.php</filename>) in the legacy Joomla 3 MVC.
    In some ways it also takes the place of the entry point file (e.g. <filename>example.php</filename> for a component
    named <code>com_example</code>) as it's the first code which is executed when our component is loaded with the
    explicit intent of rendering output.</para>

    <para>Most components do not need a custom Dispatcher. The default Dispatcher provided by Joomla is just
    fine.</para>

    <para>If you do decide to create a custom Dispatcher its class name <emphasis role="bold">MUST</emphasis> be
    <classname>\<replaceable>My</replaceable>\Component\<replaceable>ComponentName</replaceable>\Administrator\Dispatcher\Dispatcher</classname>
    (backend),
    <classname>\<replaceable>My</replaceable>\Component\<replaceable>ComponentName</replaceable>\Site\Dispatcher\Dispatcher</classname>
    (frontend) or
    <classname>\<replaceable>My</replaceable>\Component\<replaceable>ComponentName</replaceable>\Api\Dispatcher\Dispatcher</classname>
    (API application) where
    <classname>\<replaceable>My</replaceable>\Component\<replaceable>ComponentName</replaceable></classname> is the
    namespace prefix for your component, for instance <classname>\Acme\Component\Example</classname>. This custom
    Dispatcher class must extend from <classname>\Joomla\CMS\Dispatcher\ComponentDispatcher</classname>.</para>

    <para>Typically, there are two methods you might need to customise. One is <code>loadLanguage</code> which loads
    your component's language files. You may have to customise that if, for example, you need to load the backend files
    in the frontend or vice versa, or if you need to load some core component's language files on top of yours.</para>

    <para>The other method may be the <code>dispatch()</code> method which figures out the view, task and controller
    from the input and executes the component.</para>

    <title>Namespaces and MVC</title>

    <para>Before we delve into the specifics of how Models, Views, Controllers and Tables work in the Joomla 4 MVC we
    need to talk about how they are <emphasis>named</emphasis>.</para>

    <section xml:id="com-namespaces-j3">
      <title>How things worked from Joomla 1.5 to 3.10</title>

      <para>In Joomla 3 the naming convention was <code>ComponentTypeName</code> where</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><code>Component</code> is the name of the component without the <code>com_</code> prefix and with the
          first letter in uppercase. For example, if you have <code>com_example</code> the first part of an MVC class
          name was <code>Example</code>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><code>Type</code> is the type of the class you have, i.e. one of <code>Component</code>,
          <code>Model</code>, <code>View</code>, or <code>Table</code>. Again, the first letter is uppercase.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><code>Name</code> is the name of the specific MVC class with its first letter in uppercase, e.g.
          <code>Item</code>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>This conventions held true in both the front- and backend parts of your component. For example, both the
      frontend and the backend would have a class named ExampleControllerItem and they could not extend from each other.
      This led to a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of code duplication. Code duplication is the natural enemy of <link
      xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</link> (Don't Repeat Yourself) code and a
      source of the most egregious bugs. That's why this practice is mockingly called WET: Write Everything Twice. When
      you put it like that it sounds exactly as ridiculous as it is practicing it.</para>

      <para>As for file naming, things were pretty clear for Controllers, Models and Tables. The name of the file was
      the <code>Name</code> part of your class name, but in all lowercase. For example, the class
      <code>ExampleControllerItem</code> was placed in a file called <filename>item.php</filename>.</para>

      <para>Views were... a bit more complicated. A view has a <emphasis>view type</emphasis> which corresponds to the
      <parameter>format</parameter> URL parameter, the default (if not specified) being <option>html</option>. However,
      if all view classes of the <code>com_example</code> component for the view name <code>item</code> are called
      <code>ExampleViewItem</code> how does Joomla figure out which one to load for the <code>html</code>,
      <code>json</code>, <code>raw</code>, <code>feed</code> etc view types? The trick was in the <emphasis>file
      name</emphasis>. Regardless of the name of the view class, the file name the class was stored in was following the
      naming convention <filename>view.<replaceable>view_type</replaceable>.php</filename> where the
      <replaceable>view_type</replaceable> is the view type in all lowercase (corresponds to the URL
      <parameter>format</parameter> parameter). The HTML view class would be stored in a file called
      <filename>view.html.php</filename>. This was maddening because a. the file name does not include even a hint to
      the class name and b. view classes cannot extend from each other. Another case of WET.</para>

      <para>With such complicated class and file naming — not to mention one not always being related to the other — it
      was impossible to write anything that remotely resembled a working autoloader for component classes. This resulted
      in Joomla using some ugly static calls in its base controller, model, view and table classes to get the MVC object
      you wanted. Whether that worked or not depended on whether they were called from within the same component or if
      you had used other badly documented static calls to tell these base classes where to look for component classes.
      If you wanted to mix front- and backend classes… let's just say the result was not pretty.</para>

      <para>Basically, the Joomla 1.5 to 3.10 MVC class and file naming was a rolling Dumpster fire in the sixth ring of
      Hell. Yet, it was still better than nothing, i.e. what WordPress plugin developers have to contend with even to
      this day. It's funny how literally anything is better than nothing and how attached people got to what is
      objectively a bad solution which was rushed out of the door.</para>

      <para>A bit of history: The MVC in Joomla 1.5 to 3.10 was never considered “finished” by its lead developer, Johan
      Janssens. He was aware of its shortcomings but ran out of time improving it in 2006. Janssens left the project
      shortly after Joomla 1.5 was released. The MVC architecture wasn't updated significantly in subsequent versions.
      Features were still added to it, e.g. Forms support in Joomla 1.6, but the class and file naming remained
      untouched until the release of Joomla 4 in 2020.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-namespaces-j4">
      <title>How things work Joomla 4.0 onwards</title>

      <para>Fixing the hot mess of class and file naming in component's MVC was one of the priorities in Joomla 4.
      Having a CMS in 2020 (when Joomla 4 was released) still use a half-finished and proven problematic architecture
      from 2006 would just not cut it.</para>

      <para>The first step was to add <link linkend="concepts-namespaces">namespaces</link> and make sure that the <link
      linkend="com-dirs">folder and file names</link> follow the <link
      xlink:href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/">PSR-4</link> standard.</para>

      <para>Your component's namespace prefix is declared in the XML manifest of the component using a new XML element
      under the <code>&lt;extension&gt;</code> root element:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;namespace path="src"&gt;Acme\Component\Example&lt;/namespace&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The <code>path</code> attribute tells Joomla which subdirectory of your extension holds the PSR-4 of your
      extension's PHP files. It is best practice to name it <filename>src</filename> but <emphasis>you don't have
      to</emphasis>. I always assume you are using <filename>src</filename>.</para>

      <para>The text inside the XML element, <code>Acme\Component\Example</code> in our example, is the namespace prefix
      you will be using. Each component has its own namespace prefix, which consists of 3 parts:
      <classname>\<replaceable>My</replaceable>\Component\<replaceable>ComponentName</replaceable></classname>. For
      instance (as often used throughout this book) <classname>\Acme\Component\Example</classname>.</para>

      <para>The 3 parts of a component namespace prefix are as follows:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The vendor namespace prefix: a valid PHP namespace, unique for you, your company or your project. A
          valid vendor namespace prefix can for instance be <classname>\Acme</classname>. A vendor namespace prefix can
          also have sub-namespaces, for instance: <classname>\Acme\Support\Tools</classname>. You are free to choose
          your own vendor namespace, however:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>The vendor namespace should not start with <classname>\Joomla</classname>, because component
              namespaces starting withIn <classname>\Joomla</classname> are reserved for core components.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The vendor namespace should not contain a sub-namespace starting with
              <classname>\Component</classname>. It is a reserved sub-namespace, that should only be used immediately
              AFTER the vendor namespace prefix in a component namespace.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The literal string <classname>Component</classname>, with a capital C. You should use the
          <code>\Component</code> sub-namespace in the component namespace only once, to separate the vendor namespace
          prefix from the component's sub-namespace i.e. <emphasis>after</emphasis> the vendor namespace and
          <emphasis>before</emphasis> the sub-namespace with the component name.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The component sub-namespace: a valid component name for Joomla as is used in
          <code>com_componentname</code>. In simple terms, it's the same as your component's folder name, without the
          <code>com_</code> prefix. You can optionally use camel case in your sub-namespace. However, you can only use
          lowercase in your component name and folder name (everywhere you have to use <code>com_componentname</code>).
          A valid component sub-namepsacewould for instance be <classname>Example</classname> in the namespace
          <classname>Acme\Component\Example</classname> for component <code>com_example</code>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Note that this component namespace is the common namespace prefix for your entire component. Your component
      has a different namespace <emphasis>suffix</emphasis> for each of the three web applications in Joomla: frontend
      (site), backend (administrator) and api (the brand-new JSON API; this is optional).</para>

      <para>Here is how namespace prefixes work across the three Joomla applications, assuming a common namespace prefix
      <classname>Acme\Component\Example</classname>:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Component, frontend</emphasis>. The frontend classes MUST be under the namespace
          <code>\Acme\Component\Example\Site</code>. The folder <filename>components/com_example/src</filename> is the
          root of the <code>\Acme\Component\Example\Site</code> namespace.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Component, backend</emphasis>. The backend classes MUST be under the namespace
          <code>\Acme\Component\Example\Administrator</code>. The folder
          <filename>administrator/components/com_example/src</filename> is the root of the
          <code>\Acme\Component\Example\Administrator</code> namespace.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Component, API application</emphasis>. The API application classes MUST be under
          the namespace <code>\Acme\Component\Example\Api</code>. The folder
          <filename>api/components/com_example/src</filename> is the root of the
          <code>\Acme\Component\Example\Api</code> namespace.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Please note that you do not get a special namespace to use for the Joomla Console (CLI) application. You
      will be reusing the classes from the other three Joomla applications.</para>

      <para>Class names are different than, but not a huge departure from, what you had in Joomla 3. </para>

      <para>In Joomla 4 and beyond the naming convention for controllers, models and tables is
      <code>\<replaceable>NamespacePrefix</replaceable>\<replaceable>ApplicationType</replaceable>\<replaceable>Type</replaceable>\<replaceable>Name</replaceable><replaceable>Type</replaceable></code>
      where:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><replaceable>NamespacePrefix</replaceable> is your common namespace prefix, e.g.
          <code>\Acme\Component\Example</code>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><replaceable>ApplicationType</replaceable> is the type of the application part of your component i.e.
          one of <code>Site</code> (frontend), <code>Administrator</code> (backend), or <code>Api</code> (JSON API
          application).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><replaceable>Name</replaceable> is the name of the specific MVC class with its first letter in
          uppercase, e.g. <code>Item</code>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><replaceable>Type</replaceable> is the type of the class you have, i.e. one of <code>Controller</code>,
          <code>Model</code>, or <code>Table</code>. Again, the first letter is uppercase.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>All of your classes need to be placed inside the folder you have declared in your XML manifest as your
      namespace root folder, typically <code>src</code>. The files and folders under it follow the PSR-4 naming
      standard. Assuming that you have a component called <code>com_example</code>, with a namespace prefix
      <classname>Acme\Component\Example</classname> and a namespace root folder called <filename>src</filename>, the
      backend model class <classname>\Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Model\ItemModel</classname> can be found in
      the file <filename>administrator/components/com_example/src/Model/ItemModel.php</filename>.</para>

      <para>Views have a very slightly different convention because we also have the <emphasis>view type</emphasis>.
      Their naming convention is
      <code>\<replaceable>NamespacePrefix</replaceable>\<replaceable>ApplicationType</replaceable>\View\<replaceable>Name</replaceable>\<replaceable>ViewType</replaceable></code>
      where:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><replaceable>NamespacePrefix</replaceable> is your common component namespace prefix, e.g.
          <classname>\Acme\Component\Example</classname>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><replaceable>ApplicationType</replaceable> is the type of the application part of your component i.e.
          one of <code>Site</code> (frontend), <code>Administrator</code> (backend), or <code>Api</code> (JSON API
          application).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><replaceable>Name</replaceable> is the name of the specific MVC class with its first letter in
          uppercase, e.g. <code>Item</code>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><replaceable>ViewType</replaceable> corresponds to the format URL parameter with its first letter in
          uppercase, e.g. <code>Html</code>, <code>Json</code>, <code>Feed</code>, <code>Raw</code> and so on.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The HTML view class for a view called <code>item</code> of the hypothetical component we discussed above
      would have the fully qualified class name
      <classname>\Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\View\Item\HtmlView</classname> and you would find it in the file
      <filename>administrator/components/com_example/src/View/Item/HtmlView.php</filename>.</para>

      <para>Right away you can see how namespaces are benefiting us. A controller, model, or view in the frontend,
      backend and api application have a different FQN (<link
      xlink:href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.rules.php">Fully Qualified Name</link>). They no
      longer have the same name. One can extend the other if we want to, we <emphasis>can</emphasis> mix front-, backend
      and api MVC objects if we need to and all of these classes can be autoloaded without having to use weird static
      calls. Cool!</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="com-mvcfactory">
    <title>The MVCFactory</title>

    <para>In Joomla 3 you had to make a static call to the base MVC class included in Joomla itself to get an instance
    of an MVC object. For example, getting your ExampleModelItem model object you had to do something like the
    following.</para>

    <programlisting language="php">$model = \Joomla\CMS\MVC\Model\BaseDatabaseModel::getInstance('Item', 'ExampleModel');</programlisting>

    <para>If you were to do that in the frontend of the site you'd get the frontend <code>ExampleModelItem</code> class
    stored in <filename>components/com_example/models/item.php</filename>. If you were to do that in the backend of the
    site you'd get the backend <code>ExampleModelItem</code> class stored in
    <filename>administrator/components/com_example/models/item.php</filename>. If you did that from outside the
    <code>com_example</code> component, e.g. in a module or plugin, it would fail unless either the class was already
    loaded beforehand OR you had done something like</para>

    <programlisting language="php">\Joomla\CMS\MVC\Model\BaseDatabaseModel::addIncludePath(
  'components/com_example/models', 'ExampleModel'
);</programlisting>

    <para>Having to call a static method to get an object is bad architecture since the superclass where the static
    method lives in becomes a God Object — it knows way too much about how everything works in the entire CMS! Moreover,
    having the ability to auto-load classes only under certain circumstances, and having the object returned depend on
    both the application running under and magic configuration supplied by static method calls made it impossible to
    know what will be returned every time. The fact that backend and frontend classes had the exact same Fully Qualified
    Name made it impossible to double-check something didn't go awry. This loopy behaviour was a constant source of
    bugs.</para>

    <para>Joomla 4 addressed this source of endless frustration by introducing the MVCFactory service in the <link
    linkend="concepts-container">component's DI container</link>. The MVCFactory object implements the <link
    xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern">Factory method pattern</link> which means it can
    create instances of our MVC objects: controllers, models, views and tables.</para>

    <important>
      <para>Each MVCFactory object instance can only create MVC objects for a <emphasis role="bold">specific</emphasis>
      component! This is in stark contrast with the static calls in Joomla 3 which could create an MVC object for just
      about any component.</para>

      <para>This is actually a good thing! It is implementing the fundamental computer science principle called <link
      xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of Concerns</link>. Put another way,
      if I get the MVCFactory object for <code>com_example</code> I know that it can create any MVC object I need for
      <code>com_example</code> and only that components. It won't be “polluted” by any other component. Every time I
      call an MVCFactory method <emphasis role="bold">I AM 100% CONFIDENT</emphasis> I am getting the object I asked for
      and expected, not something potentially random I have no way of checking. Therefore, the MVCFactory object solves
      the single biggest source of frustration in Joomla component development. Hallelujah!</para>
    </important>

    <para>When you are writing code in a Controller or Model class you can get your own component's MVCFactory instance
    using the <code>$this-&gt;getMVCFactory()</code> method.</para>

    <para>If you are outside a component — a module, plugin, template or a different component — you can
    <emphasis>still</emphasis> get the MVCFactory of any installed and enabled component on the site as we saw in <link
    linkend="com-lifetime">the lifetime of a component</link>:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">$comContentMVCFactory = \Joomla\CMS\Factory::getApplication()
  -&gt;bootComponent('com_content')
  -&gt;getMVCFactory();</programlisting>

    <tip>
      <para>Before trying to boot a component you are supposed to check the component is installed
      <emphasis>and</emphasis> enabled. You can do that very simply, e.g. for <code>com_content</code>, with this
      code</para>

      <programlisting language="php">\Joomla\CMS\Component\ComponentHelper::isEnabled('com_content')</programlisting>
    </tip>

    <para>The MVCFactory has four public methods corresponding to the MVC objects we can create:</para>

    <bridgehead>MVCFactory and Dependency Injection</bridgehead>

    <para>The MVCFactory also performs a modicum of dependency injection. It inspects each created MVC object and checks
    which interfaces it implements. Depending on which interfaces are implemented some basic objects (form factory,
    dispatcher, router, cache controller, database object) are taken from the corresponding services in the component's
    DI container and injected into the MVC object.</para>

    <para>If you want to inject additional services you will have to extend the MVCFactory service in your component's
    service provider using a custom MVCFactory wrapper. When registering the service extension in your component's <link
    linkend="com-services">service provider</link> you can push your custom service to the MVCFactory wrapper and use it
    in the overridden methods of the wrapper. We will see an example of that <link
    linkend="com-models-push-service-joomla">pushing a custom service into a Model</link> later in this book.</para>

    <para>While this sounds like a bit of a chore, it is actually a very clean architecture. If you decide to make a
    change in your service's initialisation — or swap it out with a completely different implementation altogether — you
    can do that trivially by changing one line of code in your service provider. No more hunting down all over your
    codebase for that elusive reference to the service you are using. This is just another way Dependency Injection
    helps you write more sustainable code.</para>

    <title>Models</title>

    <para>The bulk of the implementation logic for Joomla 4 MVC models is the same as in Joomla 3 MVC.</para>

    <para>The Model classes extend from one of the base Joomla MVC Model super-classes:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Joomla\CMS\MVC\Model\BaseModel</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>The most basic model you can get. It does not connect to a database and does not support form. This is
          the kind of model you may need to use if you have a static view in your component (e.g. a control panel not
          implemented with a core <link linkend="com-dashboard">Dashboard</link>), if your model deals with data outside
          of the database (e.g. processing images, talking to a third party API over HTTP, converting files, etc) or if
          it uses an external or third party library (e.g. in Akeeba Backup the BackupModel uses our Akeeba Engine
          backup engine library).</para>

          <para>The basic service it provide is model state management using the <code>getState</code>,
          <code>setState</code> and <code>populateState</code> methods.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>In a proper MVC implementation the only way the Controller would “talk” to a Model is by setting its
            state and then reading either the return value of the method it called or inspecting the Model's
            state.</para>

            <para>In Joomla MVC the model state is a weird beast. It is ‘normally’ set by reading it from the session
            and overriding it from the request parameters using the application's <code>getUserStateFromRequest</code>
            method.</para>

            <para>While this is mostly okay for simple administrator pages listing and editing records you may find
            yourself in situations where you need to “talk” to the model from the Controller. Instead of passing this
            information around as HTTP GET/POST parameters — which can be inspected and <emphasis>overridden</emphasis>
            by a curious or malicious user — I urge you to instead override the <code>display</code> method of your
            Controller and set the Model's state after instantiating it. This is something you will not see anywhere in
            the Joomla core code but something you SHOULD be doing in your more complex components to avoid embarrassing
            and easily preventable security vulnerabilities.</para>

            <para>Speaking of which, <emphasis>always</emphasis> validate the data type and values of your model state
            in your code. Writing secure code requires you to adopt a “trust no-one” stance against any data which is
            not hard-coded into your extension's code! Do not assume that the data will be safe because (you think that)
            only a Super User can access a specific view. First of all, your assumption may be wrong. Moreover, your
            Model may be used outside the View you have in mind, even by third party components, plugins and modules
            integrating with your extension. Trust no-one, not even your own assumptions!</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>This is an extension to the BaseDatabaseModel which additionally implements Form handling.</para>

          <important>
            <para>This IS NOT the class you want to extend in pages which edit existing or create new records! What you
            are looking for in this case is Joomla\CMS\MVC\Model\AdminModel (yes, even in the frontend!).</para>
          </important>

          <para>This is the kind of Model you are going to use on pages which render a Form using an XML file for
          collecting information from the user BUT NOT for the purpose of editing or creating a record.</para>

          <para>A practical example of this is the Joomla Global Configuration page's model
          (<code>Joomla\Component\Config\Administrator\Model\ApplicationModel</code>) which does render an XML form with
          the Global Configuration option. Compare this to the article edit page's model
          (<code>Joomla\Component\Content\Administrator\Model\ArticleModel</code>) and the difference becomes evident
          right away!</para>

          <para>In your components you might want to use this type of Model in custom configuration pages. For example,
          you may have a component which post new articles automatically on social media. You may want to create
          different configurations for Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and whatnot. The page managing each of these
          configurations, each one using its own XML form file, would very likely use a Model class extending from
          <code>FormModel</code> instead of <code>AdminModel</code>.</para>

        <term>Joomla\CMS\MVC\Model\AdminModel</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>This is an extension to the <code>FormModel</code> which is designed specifically for creating new and
          editing existing records.</para>

          <para>What is the difference? Whereas <code>FormModel</code> is made to deal with the collection of arbitrary
          data, the <code>AdminModel</code> is made to create and edit records having the same data shape, defined in a
          database table. As a result, it works together with a <link linkend="com-tables">Table object</link>. Most of
          its methods will be talking to the Table object.</para>

          <para>It also supports automatic integration with content plugins and implements the methods you need to save
          new/existing records, reorder records, change record associations, batch process records, check-in and
          check-out records to the database, change the publish / trash state, and permanently delete records. Yup, this
          type of Model basically handles nearly everything you need to manage records in the backend of a site
          <emphasis>except</emphasis> listing records.</para>

          <note>
            <para>I had personally found it extremely confusing that the <code>AdminModel</code> (and the corresponding
            <code>FormController</code>) is responsible for handling all the actions you see available in the toolbar of
            a records list page. When you think about architecture it does make sense. When you are new to Joomla you
            might wonder why this is not handled by <code>ListModel</code> (and its corresponding
            <code>AdminController</code>). This is unfortunately a case of “you do this just because”, not a case of
            using what you'd intuitively think is the right thing to use. I know, right?!</para>

            <para>You may also get confused by the fact that an AdminController has a ListModel whereas a FormController
            has an AdminModel. It looks like someone had a stroke trying to name things.</para>

            <para>Thankfully, no, nobody had a stroke — the weird naming comes from the fact that when forms were
            introduced in Joomla 1.6 we had to maintain backwards compatibility to Joomla 1.5, thereby causing a class
            naming mayhem. You know what are the two hardest things in software development? Handling dates, managing
            backwards compatibility and off-by-one errors!</para>

            just to modify it. It also makes no sense to have your frontend Model extend from AdminModel and duplicate
            your code (WET code) when you can simply extend your backend model and refrain from repeating yourself (DRY

          Search Tools a.k.a. list filters) and, crucially, to provide pagination-aware list of records from a database
          table.</para>

          <para>You know how the main Joomla backend user interface pattern is a list of records? Yup, this is the Model
          which implements it.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>In the frontend of your component you will very frequently find yourself needing to list a bunch of
            items in pagination-aware lists. The traditional Joomla code pattern was to create a frontend Model which
            extended from BaseDatabaseModel and have the same code to list items copied over from the backend.</para>

            <para>Don't do that. It's WET code and I've already mentioned that it's the source of many a bug.</para>

            <para>What you will practically find yourself doing is extending the frontend Model from the backend Model.
            Unlike Joomla 3, this is now possible!</para>

            <para>You need to be acutely aware, though, that you will need to override the <code>populateState</code>
            method in the frontend model. By default, this method will accept any kind of user input for filtering the
            list of records which could indeed be used by a malicious user to display items they are not supposed to
            access!</para>

            <para>An even better approach is what I hinted to earlier. Override the <code>display</code> method of your
            Controller. In there, first do a <code>getState</code> on your model (to run the <code>populateState</code>
            and be done with it), then explicitly set the Model state using its <code>setState</code> method before
            passing it to your View object. When you do that, the state set by your Controller's code overrides whatever
            <code>populateState</code> did, thereby mitigating any security risks.</para>

      <title>Pushing services to the Model: an alternative</title>

      <para>While Joomla 4.3 and later allows you to push services into the Model using an MVCFactory wrapper which
      extends the MVC service, necessary parts of this architecture did not exist in previous Joomla versions. We will
      have to use a slightly less “architecturally clean” solution.</para>

      <para>We will <emphasis role="bold">pull</emphasis> the custom service <emphasis role="bold">from</emphasis> the
      component's DIC.</para>

      <para>First, you need to make sure that you register a service provider in <link linkend="com-services">your
      component's service provider</link> implementation:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$container-&gt;set(
  \Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Service\FacebookPublish::class,
  function (Container $container) {
    return new \Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Service\FacebookPublish();
  }
);</programlisting>

      <para>Then, you need to modify your <link linkend="com-extension">component's extension class section</link> as we
      saw on that section's “Getting access to the component's DIC anytime, anywhere” to be able to statically return
      the component's DI Container anytime, anywhere:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">protected static $dic;

public function boot(ContainerInterface $container)
{
  self::$dic = $container;
}

public static function getContainer()
{
  if (empty(self::$dic))
  {
    Factory::getApplication()
      -&gt;bootComponent('com_example');
  }

  return self::$dic;
}</programlisting>

      <para>Now your Model can simply pull the service from the Component's DIC in its constructor:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">&lt;?php
namespace Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Model;

use Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Extension\ExampleComponent;
use Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Service\FacebookPublish;
use Joomla\CMS\Form\FormFactoryInterface;
use Joomla\CMS\MVC\Factory\MVCFactoryInterface;
use Joomla\CMS\MVC\Model\AdminModel;

class ItemModel extends AdminModel
{
  private $fbPublish;

  public function __construct($config = [], MVCFactoryInterface $factory = null,
    FormFactoryInterface $formFactory = null)
  {
    parent::__construct($config, $factory, $formFactory);

    $exampleDIC      = ExampleComponent::getContainer();
    $this-&gt;fbPublish = $exampleDIC-&gt;get(FacebookPublish::class);
  }

  protected function getFacebookPublish(): FacebookPublish
  {
    return $this-&gt;fbPublish;
  }

  // The rest of your model's code goes here…
}</programlisting>

      <para>For completeness' sake, here are there are two (minor) downsides to this approach:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The Model now has a direct hard dependency on the component's extension class. For real world use inside
          Joomla this is not a big deal; the only recommended way to create instances of a component's Models is through
          its MVCFactory object which necessarily goes through the component's extension object. If you are writing Unit
          Tests, though, you can no longer isolate the Model. You will need to inject a dependency injection container
          with your custom service in the component's extension class.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The extension class has a static method to fetch the DIC. If this is not already set up it will try to
          go through the global application object to boot the component. If you are writing Unit Tests this is a
          problem, hence why I said that you need to inject a DIC to your component's extension class.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="com-controllers">
    <title>Controllers</title>

    <para>The bulk of the implementation logic for Joomla 4 MVC Controllers is the same as in Joomla 3 MVC.</para>

    <para>The logic is that most views are displayed using the component's <code>DisplayController</code> which extends
    from Joomla's <code>Joomla\CMS\MVC\Controller\BaseController</code>. You only write custom controllers when there's
    an action needed or when you need access to a Form object.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>The kind of MVC practiced by Joomla and described above is a bit “dirty”; all views share a common
      DisplayController for displaying. This is fine with Joomla's one-trick-pony components, only able to display one
      kind of information.</para>

      <para>When you have something more complex this may not be at all convenient. For example, a document management
      system might need separate views to display nested categories, available items (including the actual
      <emphasis>downloading</emphasis> part!) and uploading items, as well as viewing, adding and managing comments per
      document. In these cases it's typically much more efficient to have a separate controller per view. In components
      like that each view consists of a Controller, Model and View class (an MVC triad) which is more in line with how
      the normative MVC coding pattern is meant to work. This is perfectly possible in Joomla <emphasis>as long as you
      have a custom Dispatcher</emphasis>. You can see how I am doing that <link
      xlink:href="https://github.com/akeeba/release-system/blob/development/component/backend/src/Dispatcher/Dispatcher.php">in
      the Dispatcher of Akeeba Release System</link>, the software downloads management software used by Joomla's
      official Downloads site.</para>
    </tip>

    <para>The Controller classes extend from one of the base Joomla MVC Controller super-classes:</para>

          non-administrative actions (e.g. in the frontend).</para>

          <warning>
            <para>Heads up! In Joomla 3 the default display controller was in the root of the component as the file

            <para>In Joomla 4 and later the <code>DisplayController</code> is mostly empty except for a line like

          records in a Joomla list view: publish, unpulish, archive, trash, report, orderup, orderdown, delete, reorder,
          saveorder, checkin, checkout, saveOrderAjax and runTransition. Everything else has to be handled by a singular
          named Controller which extends FormController. Yes, that's confusing and yes, it's the source of many bugs —
          but that's the same as Joomla 3 and earlier so at least it's <emphasis>consistently
          confusing</emphasis>.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>This is an extension to the BaseController which additionally implements Form handling. This is meant to
          be used in views which add or edit a database record. Additionally, it will be used in views which handle an
          XML Form e.g. a configuration page.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>This is the controller you will be typically using for controllers whose name is <emphasis
            role="bold">singular</emphasis> such as
            <code>\Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Controller\ItemController</code>. Since this is the Item
            controller and “item” is singular it gives us a hint that it will be displaying a single item which, in the
            Joomla backend, is very likely to be an add / edit record page.</para>

            <para>In the frontend of the site you may have <emphasis role="bold">two</emphasis> controllers for the same

            a single controller, extending from FormController. You see, FormController itself extends from
            BaseController which has the display method which is used to display stuff, i.e. it already contains the

      <title>Basic services in your Controller</title>

      <para>A Controller object created by Joomla has a few basic services. In the olden days before Joomla 4 we had to
      use static methods in <code>\Joomla\CMS\Factory</code> (formerly <code>JFactory</code>) or the base MVC objects
      themselves to get access to these services. You are no longer supposed to do that, you are supposed to use the
      services provided in the Controller object itself.</para>

      <bridgehead>Application</bridgehead>

      <para>In Joomla 3 and earlier we would get the currently active application object through
      <code>\Joomla\CMS\Factory::getApplication()</code>. Do NOT do that.</para>

      <para>In Joomla 4 and later you can get the currently active application object through
      <code>$this-&gt;app</code>.</para>

      <para>Please remember that the application you are getting is not necessarily a <code>SiteApplication</code> or
      <code>AdministratorApplication</code>. It may very well be an <code>ApiApplication</code> (JSON API), a
      <code>ConsoleApplication</code> (Joomla CLI app) or even a custom application extending from
      <code>\Joomla\CMS\Application\CMSApplication</code>.</para>

      <bridgehead>Dispatcher</bridgehead>

      <para>In Joomla 3 and earlier you'd run plugin events by doing something like this:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$results = \Joomla\CMS\Factory::getApplication()
                -&gt;triggerEvent('onSomething', [$param1, $param2]);</programlisting>

      <para>In Joomla 4 and later there are two ways to call plugin events.</para>

      <para>The first method is the legacy method, going through the application's <code>triggerEvent</code> method,
      which is discouraged and will eventually go away.</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$results = $this-&gt;app-&gt;triggerEvent('onSomething', [$param1, $param2]);</programlisting>

      <para>The second and recommended method is going through the Joomla events dispatcher and using real
      events.</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$event = \Joomla\CMS\Event\GenericEvent::create('onSomething', [$param1, $param2]);
                $this-&gt;getDispatcher()-&gt;dispatch($event-&gt;getName(), $event);
                $results = $event-&gt;getArgument('result', []);</programlisting>

      <para>While this looks a bit more complicated it has some benefits.</para>

      <para>Using Events to access plugins means that you get access to a <link linkend="plg-concrete-events">concrete
      event object</link>. All core Joomla events will correspond to concrete event objects in Joomla 5.0, meaning that
      you will be able to add typehinting and have your IDE (e.g. phpStorm, Visual Studio Code, NetBeans, Eclipse, ...)
      auto-complete the argument names when manipulating an event.</para>

      <para>The real Events implemented in Joomla 4 and later, unlike plain old plugin handlers we had in Joomla 1.0 to
      3.10, can prevent some of their arguments to be modified, prescribe exactly <emphasis>what</emphasis> can be
      modified and even allow plugins to stop the processing of an event when we reach a point that further processing
      is unnecessary. If you slowly move from just using custom event names to concrete event classes you can implement
      far more complex features in your code with much less code — believe me, I've been there and done that! Event
      handling is one of those fundamental things which you are <emphasis>really</emphasis> upset it's changed but once
      you start getting the idea of how the new system works you start wondering how you could have ever written
      software without it.</para>

      <bridgehead>Input</bridgehead>

      <para>Back in the olden days we'd get the user's input by doing one of these (the more of these you remember the
      older you are — some date back to the early 00s!):</para>

      <programlisting language="php">// Joomla 1.0
$foo = \JRequest::getCmd('foo');
// Joomla 1.5
$input = new \Joomla\CMS\Input\Input();
$foo = $input-&gt;getCmd('foo');
// Joomla 1.6
$foo = Joomla\CMS\Factory::getApplication()-&gt;input-&gt;getCmd('foo');</programlisting>

      <para>This had always been a bad idea because our Controller had to <emphasis>know</emphasis> about the global
      application object and its request variables.</para>

      <para>Since Joomla 3.0 the Controller object has an <code>input</code> property which holds its own
      <code>\Joomla\CMS\Input\Input</code> object. In Joomla 3 this was typically just the application's input object
      unless you were manually constructing a controller (with a lot of effort).</para>

      <para>In Joomla 4.0 and later the input property contains its own \Joomla\CMS\Input\Input object <emphasis>which
      comes from the DI Container of the component</emphasis>. Remember that when booting a component we get access to
      its <link linkend="com-extension">component extension object</link> which has access to the component's <link
      linkend="concepts-container">DI Container</link>. This of course means that we can add <link
      linkend="com-extension-dic-proxy">a method to that object to access the DI Container</link> and set a custom input
      object, thereby implementing HMVC very easily — something that Joomla core maintainers didn't think was possible
      with the core architecture a few years ago! This means that whenever we want to create a module which displays the
      same information an existing view of our component already does, albeit in a slightly different format, all we
      need to do is create a new view template or layout and use HMVC, without having to rewrite our business logic in
      the module. We can write less code to do more. That's awesome!</para>

      <para>That is (one of the many reasons) why you should <emphasis>always</emphasis> be accessing the input as
      <code>$this-&gt;input</code> in your controllers. Now you know.</para>

      <bridgehead>MVCFactory</bridgehead>

      <para>Back in Joomla 1.0 to 3.10 creating an MVC object such as a Model, View, Table, or even another Controller
      from inside our Controller required calling static methods in the base MVC objects or proxy methods in the
      controller, like so:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$someController = \Joomla\CMS\MVC\Controller\BaseController::getInstance('Some');
$someModel = \Joomla\CMS\MVC\Model\BaseDatabaseModel::getInstance('Some', 'ExampleModel');
// or
$someModel = $this-&gt;createModel('Some', 'ExampleModel');
$someView = $this-&gt;createView('Some', 'ExampleView', 'Html');
$someTable = \Joomla\CMS\Table\Table::getInstance('Some', 'ExampleTable');</programlisting>

      <para>There are two things which strike us as suboptimal:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>There is no consistency in how you create MVC objects. Some are static calls, some are method calls to
          proxy functions.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>There is no consistency in the arguments you provide. Creating a controller only needs its name (and
          requires the magic configuration array key <code>base_path</code> if you want to get a controller from a
          component other than the current one), creating anything else requires us to give it the prefix of the MVC
          class name (not just the component name).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>This is what we'd call “sanity came here to die”.</para>

      <para>Joomla 3.10 introduced the MVCFactory for creating models, views and tables and Joomla 4.0 extended it by
      also letting it create controllers. See how easier and more consistent everything is now:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">// Only on Joomla 4.0 and later
$someController = $this-&gt;getMVCFactory()-&gt;createController('Some', 'Administrator');
// Joomla 3.10 and later
$someModel = $this-&gt;getMVCFactory()-&gt;createModel('Some', 'Administrator');
$someView = $this-&gt;getMVCFactory()-&gt;createView('Some', 'Administrator', 'Html');
$someTable = $this-&gt;getMVCFactory()-&gt;createTable('Some', 'Administrator');
// Inside the Controller I can still do this (4.0 and later):
$someModel = $this-&gt;getModel('Some', 'Administrator');
$someView = $this-&gt;getView('Some', 'Administrator', 'Html');</programlisting>

      <para>First of all, we see that creating MVC objects is now very consistent and easier.</para>

      <para>Second, we notice that the <code>$prefix</code> argument is no longer something component-specific (such as
      <code>ExampleModel</code>) but simply the side of the application (Site, Administrator or Api) that we want to get
      the MVC object from.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Tables are only available in the Administrator side of the application. While you can theoretically define
        different Table classes in the frontend (Site) or JSON API (Api) side it's not a good idea as you will very
        likely run into issues where the “wrong” table class is being used. As a result, it's advisable to always call
        <code>createTable</code> with two parameters and set the second parameter to
        <option>Administrator</option>).</para>
      </note>

      <para>Legacy Joomla 3 components still work despite the apparent backwards compatibility (b/c) break in the
      <code>getModel</code> and <code>getView</code> methods. Why is that? Well, it's because Joomla 4 uses the
      <code>\Joomla\CMS\MVC\Factory\LegacyFactory</code> instead of <code>\Joomla\CMS\MVC\Factory\MVCFactory</code> for
      these components. The LegacyFactory is aware of the b/c break and acts accordingly so you, the extensions
      developer, do not suffer. This is possible because each component has its own DI Container. So that's another way
      how using a DI Container allowed Joomla to create an updated, richer MVC API without breaking backwards
      compatibility with Joomla 3 — at least until Joomla 6.0. Neat, huh?</para>

      <para>As a developer, you should remember this when you are inside a Controller writing code:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If you want to get a Model or View use the controller's <code>getModel</code> and <code>getView</code>
          methods.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you want to get another <code>Controller</code> or a <code>Table</code> do not instantiate them
          directly! Always go through the MVCFactory.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The second argument to all these methods is the application side you are getting an object from. Leave
          it empty to use the <emphasis>current</emphasis> application side or pass an explicit value. If you leave it
          empty keep in mind that, for example, your backend controller may be running in the frontend. In this case, do
          you <emphasis>really</emphasis> want to get the frontend model?</para>

  <section xml:id="com-views">
    <title>Views</title>

    <para>Views, in Joomla 3, referred to two different things: the View classes and the view templates. In fact, the
    view templates were placed in a <code>tmpl</code> folder under each View's folder which was a bad idea: you had the
    output rendering in a subdirectory of the business logic, making it hard to discern when one ends and the other
    begins.</para>

    <para>In Joomla 4 there is a separation of these two very different types of code. The view classes (which we will
    call Views) are placed in the <filename>src/View</filename> folder with one subdirectory for each view in
    <code>Uppercasefirst</code> format. The view templates are placed in the <filename>tmpl</filename> folder in your

  <section xml:id="com-tables">
    <title>Tables</title>

    <para>Tables, or rather Table classes, in Joomla's MVC are an abstraction to a row of an actual database table. They
    are used internally by Models to create new records, modify existing records and delete old records. It's not
    exactly an <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern">Active Record</link> pattern as it
    does not really participate in the R (Read) of the <link
    xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</link> operations — Joomla's models
    query the database directly for listing multiple records and returning a single record. It also does not handle
    relationships. Like, at all.</para>

    <para>The logic of how Table classes work has not changed between Joomla 3 and 4. They are namespaced and they have
    the familiar superclasses they extend from:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>\Joomla\CMS\Table\Table</term>

          <para>A record in a database table which supports <link
          xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model">Nested Sets</link> (think how categories work,
          where categories can be placed under other categories and so on).</para>

          <para>The table MUST have the following columns:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><code>parent_id</code>. The primary key of the parent node. Provides adjacency list data for

            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><code>level</code>. The depth level of the node in the tree.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><code>lft</code>. The left value of the node for managing its placement in the nested sets
              tree.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para><code>rgt</code>. The right value of the node for managing its placement in the nested sets
              tree.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><code>alias</code>. The alias of this node used to construct the full text path, forward-slash
              delimited.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <note>
            <para>Nested Sets are very slow when you need to add, remove, and reorder records. It's not necessary to use
            a Nested table to create a nested structure. In some use cases where writing is very common and the number
            of items in each nested structure rather limited (e.g. nested comments) it may actually be easier to only
            store the parent ID of each node and calculate the tree structure in PHP code. The read performance is
            comparable within a few dozen milliseconds but the write performance can be over 100 times(!!!) faster when
            you have more than a couple thousand records.</para>

            <para>On that note, do remember that Joomla uses a Nested table for the <database>#__assets</database>
            records. Everything that has its own permissions such as categories, articles, banners, contacts,
            extensions, custom data types you add with an asset ID, etc also has a record in that table. That's why as a
            site grows in size operations against these records become increasingly slow.</para>

            <para>Unfortunately, this cannot be (easily) solved in Joomla; nested assets are a cornerstone of Joomla
            access control since version 1.6. The only real solution would be using a graph database which is
            impractical; neither MySQL nor PostgreSQL, the two database server technologies supported by Joomla and
            widely found on commercial hosting, have graph features (they are relational databases a.k.a. <link
            xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS">RDBMS</link>).</para>

            <para>So, if you find yourself in a situation where you need nested sets but can't afford the performance
            hit after adding thousands or millions of records and calculating the tree in memory using PHP code is
            impractical (and cannot be cached in a sensible manner) ask yourself: am I actually developing for the right
            database server and platform? Not all software can be written for Joomla and MySQL / PostgreSQL and that's
            alright. We are software engineers; our job is to find the right tool for the job and use it in the most
            efficient way possible to make something new and functional.</para>

    <para>The rest of this section is mostly tips and tricks for using Tables the way Joomla intended — and even more
    efficiently!</para>

    <section xml:id="com-tables-get-object">
      <title>Getting the table object</title>

      <para>As noted in the <link linkend="com-mvcfactory">MVCFactory</link> section, you are no longer meant to
      instantiate Table objects using static method calls. You are meant to go through MVCFactory's
      <code>createTable</code> method.</para>

      <para>In the olden days we'd do something like this:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">// Returns the Item table from com_example (ExampleTableItem)
$table = \Joomla\CMS\Table\Table::getInstance('Item', 'ExampleTable');</programlisting>

      <para>While this still works for old components written with the Joomla 3 MVC, it's part of the backwards
      compatibility with legacy component code and will eventually be removed. In fact, the <emphasis>only</emphasis>
      time you are supposed to use this in Joomla 4 is when interfacing an old component which has not been migrated to
      the Joomla 4 architecture yet.</para>

      <para>For components based on the Joomla 4+ MVC this won't work at all! You need to go through the MVCFactory of
      the extension.</para>

      <para>If you are inside a Controller or Model and need to get a Table object instance for a Table class which
      belongs <emphasis>to your own component</emphasis> you must do:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">/**
 * Gets a NEW table object for the Item table in the Administrator section of the component, e.g.
 * \Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Table\ItemTable
 */
$table = $this-&gt;getMVCFactory()-&gt;createTable('Item', 'Administrator');</programlisting>

      <para>In any other case you will need to boot the component through the application object to get its MVCFactory
      to create the table instance. For example:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">// It's best to have the application object injected to your code instead of using this...
$app = \Joomla\CMS\Factory::getApplication();
// Get the table
$table = $app-&gt;bootComponent('com_example')
  -&gt;getMVCFactory()
  -&gt;createTable('Item', 'Administrator');</programlisting>

      <para>Going through the MVCFactory makes sure that the table is constructed correctly. Remember, as we saw <link
      linkend="com-models-push-service-joomla">in the Model section</link>, you can push custom services into any MVC
      object — including Tables — through a custom MVCFactory decorator. This means that the only forwards compatible
      method of getting a Table object which will always work is going through the MVCFactory of its component.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-tables-check">
      <title>Customising the validation</title>

      <para>One of the many jobs of a Table object is to validate the data before it's written to the database. This is
      done in its <code>check()</code> method.</para>

      <para>You can override that method in your custom Table classes to add custom validation. At the very least you
      should validate the data type and that the data is within an accepted range of values. The latter is
      domain-specific, i.e. you need to know how your database table and component work to write that code. That's why
      Joomla doesn't offer much in the way of automatic data validation.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-tables-events">
      <title>Using plugin events</title>

      <para>Table classes can call plugin events. For example, Joomla's default <code>Table::check()</code>
      implementation goes through the <code>onTableCheck</code> plugin event to let plugins perform additional data
      validation before data is written to the database.</para>

      <para>The Table superclasses offer a <code>getDispatcher()</code> method to get a reference to Joomla's Events
      Dispatcher object. As we noted in the <link linkend="com-controllers-basic-services">Controllers</link> section
      this is the preferred way to use plugins in Joomla 4 and beyond.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-tables-docblocks">
      <title>Add type hints with phpDoc DocBlocks and @property</title>

      <para>The Table classes do NOT declare concrete public properties for most of the database table columns. Instead,
      they use implied public properties — and eventually the magic <code>__get()</code> and <code>__set()</code> PHP
      methods as PHP 9 will remove support for implied public properties in objects which do not extend directly from
      <code>\stdClass</code>.</para>

      <para>This means that when you get a Table object and type-hint it correctly, like the example below, your IDE
      will not offer any auto-completion suggestions or type hints for the database table columns supported by your
      table class.</para>

      <programlisting language="php">/** @var \Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Table\ItemTable **/
$table = $this-&gt;getMVCFactory()-&gt;createTable('Item', 'Administrator');</programlisting>

      <para>I find this annoying. The whole reason we're using an IDE is so we don't have to remember a large number of
      little things, like how the table columns are named in every table of every table the core CMS or our component is
      using.</para>

      <para>Luckily, this is trivial to fix.</para>

      <para>Given the following table definition:</para>

      <programlisting language="mysql">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `#__example_items` (
  `id`          bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `catid`       bigint(20)          NOT NULL,
  `fromname`    varchar(255)        NOT NULL,
  `fromemail`   varchar(255)        NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `subject`     varchar(255)        NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `body`        mediumtext          NOT NULL,
  `enabled`     tinyint(3)          NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  `token`       char(32)                     DEFAULT NULL,
  `created_on`  datetime            NULL     DEFAULT NULL,
  `created_by`  bigint(20)          NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `modified_on` datetime            NULL     DEFAULT NULL,
  `modified_by` bigint(20)          NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `locked_on`   datetime            NULL     DEFAULT NULL,
  `locked_by`   bigint(20)          NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE = InnoDB
  DEFAULT COLLATE = utf8mb4_unicode_ci;</programlisting>

      <para>You can add the following phpDoc DocBlock at the top of your class:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">/**
 * @property int    $id            The primary key
 * @property int    $catid         The category ID, foreign key to #__categories
 * @property string $fromname      Name of the sender
 * @property string $fromemail     Email address of the sender
 * @property string $subject       Subject line of this contact item
 * @property string $body          Body text of this contact item
 * @property int    $enabled       Is it published?
 * @property string $token         Reply token
 * @property string $created_on    Date and time the record was created
 * @property int    $created_by    ID of the user who created the record
 * @property string $modified_on   Date and time the record was last modified
 * @property int    $modified_by   ID of the user who last modified the record
 * @property string $locked_on     Date and time the record was locked
 * @property int    $locked_by     ID of the user who locked the record
*/</programlisting>

      <para>Now you get full auto-completion, type hinting and inline documentation for your table columns. You're
      welcome!</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-tables-relations">
      <title>Basic relation management with getters and setters</title>

      <para>As noted earlier in this section, Joomla does not really offer a full implementation of the Active Record
      pattern — at least, not yet. One of the biggest omissions is relationships.</para>

      <para>Let's say that we have a helpdesk ticket system. Each support ticket has one or more posts. Conversely, each
      post has exactly one ticket. Posts and tickets are database tables with corresponding Table classes. I actually
      wrote such a component and found myself too often having to get the ticket a post belongs to, usually many times
      within the same request. Sure I can instantiate a TicketTable object and have it load the data off the database
      but if I'm doing that several times in a request it's slow and unhelpful. So, how about we “upgrade” our PostTable
      to return our ticket object? It's quite easy, really!</para>

      <programlisting language="php">&lt;?php

use Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Table\TicketTable;

class PostTable extends \Joomla\CMS\Table\Table
{
  /**
   * Ticket this post belongs to
   *
   * @var   TicketTable|null
   */
  private $ticket;

  /**
   * Get the ticket this post belongs to

   */
  public function getTicket(): ?TicketTable
  {
    if (is_null($this-&gt;ticket))

        throw new RuntimeException('There is no such ticket');

  public function setTicket(?TicketTable $ticket, bool $force = false): self

   */
  public function reset()

    $this-&gt;ticket = null;

    parent::reset();

}</programlisting>

      <note>
        <para>I am instantiating the TicketTable directly because, in this case, I know I can safely do so. If my
        TicketTable had dependencies on other tables I should be going through the MVCFactory. I decided to keep it
        simple here because there's already a lot going on.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The idea can be broken down in the following steps:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Create a private property to hold our related object, in this case the ticket the post belongs
          to.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Reset that property back to NULL in the <code>reset()</code> method.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Create a setter which sets the relationship <emphasis>if and only if</emphasis> the TicketTable object
          we're passing matches the post table's <code>ticket_id</code> column value. The setter is optional; it makes
          it easier for us when creating both a new post and a new ticket i.e. when a client submits a new helpdesk
          item.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Create a getter which returns the already saved relationship object. If none is specified, we load it
          from the database.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>This is very naive, late-bound relationship handling (lazy loading) but it's better than nothing.</para>

      <para>If you'd like to do eager relationship loading (when loading a big list of posts) you'd have to implement it
      yourself. For starters, you'd need something like that in your PostTable:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">/**
 * @param   self[]  $postTables
 */
public function eagerLoad(array &amp;$postTables): void
{
  // Get the unique ticket IDs
  $ticketIDs = array_map(
    function (PostTable $x) {
      return $x-&gt;ticket_id;
    },
    $postTables
  );
  $ticketIDs = array_unique($ticketIDs);

  // Get the raw ticket data, keyed by ticket ID
  $db = $this-&gt;getDbo();
  $query = $db-&gt;getQuery(true)
    -&gt;select('*')
    -&gt;from('#__example_tickets')
    -&gt;whereIn($db-&gt;quoteName('id'), $ticketIDs);
  $tickets = $db-&gt;setQuery($query)-&gt;loadObjectList('id') ?: [];

  // Convert the raw ticket data into TicketTable objects
  $tickets = array_map(
    function (object $rawData): TicketTable
    {
      $ticket = new TicketTable($this-&gt;getDbo(), $this-&gt;getDispatcher());
      $ticket-&gt;bind($rawData);

      return $ticket;
    },
    $tickets
  );

  // Set the TicketTable objects to each PostTable object
  foreach ($postTables as $postTable)
  {
    $postTable-&gt;setTicket($tickets[$postTable-&gt;ticket_id]);
  }
}            </programlisting>

      <para>Now, whenever you write code which returns an array of PostTable objects just run the resulting through that
      method and it set the related TicketObject instances to each member of the array of PostTable objects.</para>

      <para>Why do eager loading? With eager loading you only need 2 queries: one to get the list of posts data, one to
      get the list of tickets data. With lazy loading you'd need N + 1 database queries: one to get the list of posts
      data, one per post (N queries in total) to get each post's ticket data.</para>

      <para>Eager loading only makes sense if you are going to process a large number of records all at once and you are
      definitely going to need access to their related objects.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-tables-assets">
      <title>Asset management</title>

      <para>In some cases you want your database records to have a special set of permissions which can override those
      set for the entire component in its Options. This is especially important if you are using the Joomla Categories,
      in which case your items may belong to a category, which belongs in another category, which belongs in another
      category… This cascading of permissions is made easy with Joomla's assets management.</para>

      <para>To enabled assets management in your table you need to have an <code>asset_id</code> column in your database
      table. This sets <code>$this-&gt;_trackAssets = true</code> when your table object is constructed (no need to do
      it manually).</para>

      <para>Moreover, you MAY have to override the _<code>getAssetParentId</code>, <code>_getAssetName</code> and
      <code>_getAssetTitle</code> methods if your items described by this table class belong in categories. Look at
      <code>\Joomla\CMS\Table\Content</code> to understand what is going on.</para>

      <para>Finally, your <code>bind()</code> method needs to be overwritten so you can call the
      <code>$this-&gt;setRules()</code> method against the raw, JSON-encoded permissions data stored in the database
      table. Saving rules is automatic; you don't have to handle it yourself.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-tables-arrays-and-json">
      <title>Working with arrays and JSON data</title>

      <para>Sometimes you need to work with arrays of values or data which is stored as JSON but needs to be accessed as
      an object or array. Don't worry, this is possible with Joomla's Table class, albeit not immediately
      obvious.</para>

      <para>Let's say you want to work with array data in a column called <database>params</database>, stored in the
      database as a JSON-encoded string. You will need to think about three things:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Resetting a table. By default, Joomla uses the default value you have for the same named column in your
          database table. You want to change that to an empty array.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Binding data. When Joomla loads a record and when we call the table object's <code>save()</code> method
          to create or modify a record, Joomla always calls the <code>bind()</code> method to set up the object's
          properties in way which makes sense for use in the code. In there we will need to convert our encoded field
          into an array.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Storing data. The store() method needs the data in the record to be in a format which can be stored in
          the database table as-is. The plan here is to convert the array data to JSON before this method executes and
          convert out data back to array data right before this method returns.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <programlisting language="php">class ItemTable extends \Joomla\CMS\Table\Table
{
  public function bind($src, $ignore = [])
  {
    $src           = (array) $src;
    $src['params'] = @json_decode($src['params']);

    return parent::bind($src, $ignore);
  }

  public function store($updateNulls = false)
  {
    $this-&gt;params = @json_decode($this-&gt;params ?? '{}', true) ?? [];

    $result = parent::store($updateNulls);

    $this-&gt;params = @json_encode($this-&gt;params) ?? '{}';

    return $result;
  }

  public function reset()
  {
    parent::reset();

    $this-&gt;params = [];
  }
}</programlisting>

      <para>Nothing stops you from using a <code>\Joomla\Registry\Registry</code> object instead of a plain array; in
      fact, it may be easier to manage. You may also have multiple fields in need of this kind of conversion.</para>

      <para>Another practical example is multi-select form fields, e.g. selecting one or more usergroups. The resulting
      array of integers can be easily converted to a comma-separated string for saving in the database.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="com-html">
    <title>HTML helper service</title>

    <para>Joomla has long provided a mechanism for creating your own HTML helper classes. These are meant to provide
    relatively short methods which return HTML snippets based on data which requires more than a line or two of PHP code
    to be processed and/or is called frequently enough throughout your component that it makes no sense having to the
    same thing over and over again. For example, you could have methods which return item associations, format dates,
    load a layout for presenting user information in backend grid views etc.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Joomla 4 HTML helpers are services registered through your extension

        <code>\Joomla\CMS\HTML\HTMLHelper::_()</code> method</emphasis>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <bridgehead>How we did things in Joomla 3</bridgehead>

    <para>Back in Joomla 3 we'd create a class file in our <filename>helpers/html</filename> folder, e.g.
    <filename>administrator/components/helpers/html/example.php</filename>. It would contain a pure static class with a
    name starting with <code>JHtml</code>, e.g <code>JHtmlExample</code>. Here's a trivial example:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">&lt;?php
class JHtmlExample {
  public static function hello($who) {
    $who = htmlspecialchars($who);
    
    return "&lt;p&gt;Hello, {$who}!&lt;/p&gt;";
  }
}</programlisting>

    <para>Within our component the helper was automatically registered and we could use it like this:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">&lt;?php echo \Joomla\CMS\HTML\HTMLHelper::_('example.hello', 'world') ?&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>This would result in</para>

    <screen>&lt;p&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/p&gt;</screen>

    <para>Outside our component we'd have to remember to register this helper manually:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">\Joomla\CMS\HTML\HTMLHelper::addIncludePath(JPATH_ADMINISTRATOR .
  '/components/com_example/helpers/html');</programlisting>

    <para>When we forgot to do that, e.g. in a module of ours? Hilarity ensued…</para>

    <para>This approach also had other problems. What if there are two helpers, one of ours and one of another
    component, using the same class name? PHP Fatal Error! What happens if we use a name for our helper which “shades” a
    name used by Joomla itself? We break things! What happens if the service we need to use is not available as a static
    method? Ugly workarounds! Generally speaking, it was a bad idea but, like most things in older versions of Joomla,
    was better than nothing which made it good enough.</para>

    <bridgehead>The way to do it in Joomla 4</bridgehead>

    <para>In Joomla 4 we will create a <emphasis>service</emphasis>. It sounds big and scary but... let me tell you a
    secret. We are just going to create a regular PHP class. It does not extend from anything, it does not have any
    special requirements. That's right, we are writing the simplest possible PHP class.</para>

    <programlisting language="php">&lt;?php
namespace Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Service\Html;

class Example {
  public function hello($who) {
    $who = htmlspecialchars($who);

    return "&lt;p&gt;Hello, {$who}!&lt;/p&gt;";
  }
}</programlisting>

    <para>Now we can instantiate it in our component's extension class's boot method.</para>

    <programlisting language="php">&lt;?php
namespace Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Extension;

use Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Service\Html\Example;

class Example extends MVCComponent implements BootableExtensionInterface {

  public function boot(ContainerInterface $container)
  {
    $this-&gt;getRegistry()-&gt;register('example', new Example());
  }
}</programlisting>

    <bridgehead>Pushing services</bridgehead>

    <para>In the Joomla 3 paradigm the HTML helper class was static, meaning that any services it needs would have to be
    fetched with static or otherwise global calls as well. For example, getting the database driver object would require
    doing <code>\Joomla\CMS\Factory::getDbo()</code>. In Joomla 4 this kind of static calls is deprecated. So, how do
    you do it?</para>

    <para>The trick is that you can push services using the HTML helper class's constructor. For example, pushing the
    database:</para>

    <para><programlisting language="php">&lt;?php
namespace Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Service\Html;

    them. You get the idea!</para>

    <title>Categories</title>

    <para>Sometimes your components may need to use Joomla's Categories feature. I am not talking about using content
    categories, where articles are placed in. I am talking about having Joomla manage categories for your own items.
    This is what Joomla itself is doing for its core components like Contacts and Banners.</para>

    <para>Using Joomla's categories instead of inventing your own categorisation has many benefits. The obvious benefit
    is that users are exposed to a familiar and consistent category management interface. Beyond the obvious, this is
    the only way you can have nice things such as <link linkend="com-fields">integration with custom
    fields</link>.</para>

    <section xml:id="com-categories-db">
      <title>Database schema changes</title>

      <para>Your table which contains the <emphasis>items</emphasis> which go into each category needs to have a few
      columns:</para>

      <programlisting language="mysql">`id`          BIGINT(20)    NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT 'Item unique ID',
`catid`       BIGINT(20)    NOT NULL COMMENT 'Category ID',
`state`       TINYINT(3)    NOT NULL DEFAULT '1' COMMENT 'Publish status',</programlisting>

      <para>These fields don't necessarily need to have these names; we can change them in the code. However, these
      column names are the default used in Joomla and it makes it easier for you to follow third party tutorials and for
      other people to follow what you are doing with your code.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-categories-manifest">
      <title>Changes to your XML manifest and forms</title>

      <para>A lot of this integration is, in fact, smoke and mirrors. Users are taken to the core
      <code>com_categories</code> component to manage categories. <code>com_categories</code> uses a form in our
      component, in the file
      <filename>administrator/components/<replaceable>com_example</replaceable>/forms/category.xml</filename> where
      <replaceable>com_example</replaceable> is our component, to add sections to the category configuration beyond the
      standard Joomla stuff. The way Joomla's main menu works along with a small change in our XML manifest will make
      the user think they are still in our component while they are using Joomla's com_categories.</para>

      <para>For the user to have a way to manage categories and maintain the illusion they remain in our extension you
      have to add the following code in your XML manifest under &lt;extension&gt;, &lt;administration&gt;,
      &lt;submenu&gt;:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;menu link="option=com_categories&amp;amp;extension=<replaceable>com_example</replaceable>"&gt;JCATEGORIES&lt;/menu&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>where <replaceable>com_example</replaceable> is the name of your component.</para>

      <para>By default, you'll get a rather barren category edit page with just the bare minimum of information Joomla
      needs to store about a category (a title, alias and description are required — you can't hide them or remove them
      in any way). The basic tabs you get in the category editor are Category, Options, Publishing, Fields (if any
      custom Fields are set up for the category) and Permissions.</para>

      <para>You can display additional tabs with component-specific configuration options by creating the file
      <filename>administrator/components/<replaceable>com_example</replaceable>/forms/category.xml</filename> where
      <replaceable>com_example</replaceable> is the name of your component. This is a regular Joomla XML form file. Just
      remember, every <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> you add becomes a tab in the Category edit page. Neat, huh?</para>

      <title>The Category service</title>

      <para>Categories are great and all, but if you need to get their parameters or create SEF routes for nested

      <para>Now you see why I told you to use the database table field names customarily used by Joomla; they minimise
      the code you need to write down to two array keys: <code>extension</code> and <code>table</code>.</para>

      <para>Unlike other services provided by your component, the category service is instantiated directly:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$catService = new Acme\Component\Example\Site\Service\Category([]);</programlisting>

      <para>The array in the constructor arguments is not just for show. It can help you narrow down the list of

        <varlistentry>
          <term>access</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Boolean. When true, Joomla will only return the categories visible to the current user. It does that
            by only getting from the database the categories whole <database>access</database> field is one of the
            Joomla viewing access levels the current user has access to.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>published</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Integer 0 or 1. When it's 1 it will only return categories which are published. When 0 it will return
            published, unpublished <emphasis>and trashed</emphasis> categories.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>countItems</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Integer 0 or 1. Note the weird capitalisation in the middle of this key's name! When it's 1, Joomla
            will return the number of items contained in each category at the expense of performance. Use this sparingly
            and only when you absolutely need it e.g. when displaying paginated views.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>Also keep in mind that Joomla tries to be smart. A bit <emphasis>too</emphasis> smart, maybe. When you are
      on a multilingual site it will only return categories whose language is either the currently selected language or
      “All” (denoted by a <code>*</code> in the language column of the <database>#__categories</database> table). If you
      want to override this behaviour you will need to change your Categories Service constructor like so:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">public function __construct($options)
{
  $options = array_merge($options, [
    'extension'  =&gt; 'com_example',
    'table'      =&gt; '#__example_items',
    'field'      =&gt; 'catid',
    'key'        =&gt; 'id',
    'statefield' =&gt; 'state',
  ]);

  parent::__construct($options);

  $this-&gt;_options['currentlang'] = $options['currentlang'] ?? $this-&gt;_options['currentlang'];
}</programlisting>

      <para>If you want the instance of the Categories Service to return all categories regardless of the current
      language in a multilingual site you can now do:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$catService = new Acme\Component\Example\Site\Service\Category([
  'currentlang' =&gt; 0
]);</programlisting>

      <title>The case for URL routing</title>

      <para>By default, Joomla's frontend URLs look something like this:</para>

      <para><uri>https://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_example&amp;view=item&amp;id=123&amp;Itemid=456</uri></para>

      <para>This is called a regular or non-SEF URL. The SEF URL — what other CMS may call a “permalink” or a
      “<emphasis>route</emphasis>” — could be something like</para>

      <para><uri>https://www.example.com/acme-shop/roadrunner-hunting/explosives/tnt-crate.html</uri></para>

      <note>
        <para><acronym>SEF</acronym> is an acronym which stands for Search Engine Friendly and is called like that for
        historical reasons — back in 2001 when Joomla's predecessor, Mambo, introduced this feature a
        human-understandable URL was also helping the primitive search engines of that era to get better context of what
        the page is about. This stopped being true by the time Joomla emerged as its own software, in 2005.</para>

        <para>Joomla co-founder Brian Teeman coined a better, if not much more British, term: Pub Ear Friendly. The idea
        being that when you try to give the URL of a page to your mate while downing pints at your local, rather lively,
        pub it's easier to give them a few words they can understand than a long string of alphanumeric characters. For
        some reason this alternate term never stuck…</para>
      </note>

      <para>The transformation of the ugly, incomprehensible (at least to non-developers), non-SEF URL into the SEF URL
      and of the SEF URL back to the ugly non-SEF version (so Joomla can figure out which component to load and what to
      tell it to do) is called <emphasis role="bold">SEF routing</emphasis> in the Joomla vernacular. Most everywhere
      else you will see it being called <emphasis role="bold">URL routing</emphasis>. Well, the Joomla vernacular is
      full of certain historical quirks which makes it harder for newcomers to figure out what is what, but this is
      neither here nor there.</para>

      <para>URL routing in Joomla is implemented in the core. However, the core code cannot
      <emphasis>possibly</emphasis> know how your component is supposed to logically structure its content so as to
      convert this into a human and machine understandable URL. Therefore it delegates that responsibility to the
      component, namely to our component's Router.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-router-abandon-all-hope">
      <title>Intermission: abandon all hope ye who enter here</title>

      <para>Before we go on, let's discuss a little bit how Joomla URL routing works. It's long, it's a bit depressing,
      but read to the end — as you'll see, all problems with the URL routing in Joomla are ultimately <emphasis
      role="bold">a user education issue</emphasis>, not a coding issue.</para>

      <para>You would expect web software to have have absolutely deterministic, clear routing for URLs. Given a set of
      URL parameters (the “non-SEF URL”) the URL router (“SEF router”) will spit out the same route (“SEF URL”). In this
      ideal world we already have nuclear fusion and world peace, we have solved poverty and hunger and… I
      digress.</para>

      <para>In the imperfect world we live in, web software has to choose one of two evils. URL routing is either
      extremely technical and inflexible but robust, or it is is user-friendly and flexible but can result in some very
      weird situations. Joomla chose the latter. It's what allows modules to work the way they do which is one of the
      many reasons Joomla is an insanely powerful but still user-friendly CMS. But which part of its soul did it have to
      sell to you-know-who to do that? Let's see…</para>

      <para>URL routing in Joomla operates in two axes. On one hand we have the user-defined menu structure which
      operates as the first pass of URL routing and is defined by users, who are humans and not very good at managing
      hierarchies (make that <emphasis>doubleplusungood</emphasis>, Winston). Then you have the SEF router of our
      component which, unlike users, works in a perfectly logical, orderly fashion.</para>

      <para>The thing is, they are both working at the same time to do URL routing and this can cause some… uh…
      <emphasis>complications</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Let's say you have the following data hierarchy:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Category A, alias <code>alpha</code>.</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Category B, alias <code>bravo</code>.</para>

              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>Article C, alias <code>charlie</code></para>
                </listitem>
              </itemizedlist>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>And you have the following menu structure (as to why the user chose this seemingly bonkers menu structure,
      no, they are not trying to sabotage your code, they have a good reason but we'll get back to that later):</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Category item list for Category B, alias <code>bravo</code>. Item ID 123.</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Single article view for Article C, alias <code>charlie</code>. Item ID 234.</para>

              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>Category A, alias <code>alpha</code>. Item ID 345.</para>
                </listitem>
              </itemizedlist>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>You would expect that the URL for category A is https://www.example.com/alpha, category B's is
      https://www.example.com/alpha/bravo and article C's is https://www.example.com/alpha/bravo/charlie.</para>

      <para>Nope.</para>

      <para>The URL for category A is <uri>https://www.example.com/bravo/charlie/alpha</uri> per the menu
      structure.</para>

      <para>The URL for category B is <uri>https://www.example.com/bravo</uri> per the menu structure.</para>

      <para>The URL for article C is <uri>https://www.example.com/bravo/charlie</uri> per BOTH the menu structure AND
      the SEF router of com_content.</para>

      <para>However, it's perfectly possible to access article C as https://www.example.com/bravo/charlie/alpha/charlie.
      The first three parts of the route (/bravo/charlie/alpha) are the menu structure to category A. The rest
      (bravo/charlie) is handled by the SEF router of com_content.</para>

      <para>*record scratch*</para>

      <para>But, wait, wait a second! How does Joomla know when to use each URL?! I am glad you asked, the answer is the
      <code>Itemid</code> URL parameter, i.e. the menu item ID for which we are going to be generating a URL for our…
      something!</para>

      <para>If we are routing the URL to article C using a URL with Itemid=123 Joomla will first figure out that we have
      a menu item to Article C's parent category (Category B). It will then ask our URL router to route this item in
      this category which will make our com_content router return <code>charlie</code>. Therefore Joomla will return the
      relative URL <code>bravo/charlie</code>.</para>

      <para>If we are routing the URL to article C using a URL with Itemid=234 Joomla sees that the Itemid matches
      exactly what we need to route, therefore it will return the menu structure up to this point, i.e. the relative URL
      <code>bravo/charlie</code>.</para>

      <para>HOLD ON A SECOND! Both of these methods returned… THE SAME URL! Ah, keen eyed reader, you are right! I can
      see you despairing. Oh, please, not yet! It's about to get <emphasis>worse</emphasis>. You see, when Joomla parses
      the URL it prioritises the menu structure over the SEF router of each component. Since <code>bravo/charlie</code>
      is, indeed, a valid menu structure it will simply return the non-SEF URL index.php?Itemid=234 — in both
      cases.</para>

      <para>But, but, but… Isn't the Itemid how we tell modules when to display? Why, yes, it is! Oh, you had different
      modules displaying in menu items 123 and 234? Too bad! You don't get to choose. Sorry.</para>

      <para>Back to routing non-SEF to SEF URLs. If you route article C using a URL with Itemid=345 Joomla tells you
      that you are on category A. So your SEF route has to find a full path to your article which would be bravo/charlie
      and this is added to Category A, menu item 345's URL of bravo/charlie/alpha to make the entirely confusing URL
      bravo/charlie/alpha/bravo/charlie which works perfectly.</para>

      <para>What about trying to route article C without an Itemid? Now things get a bit tastier and testier. Joomla
      will try to find the most relevant route using the segments returned by your SEF router and trying to match them
      with the menu structure… Which one it is? Frankly, I don't have the foggiest off the top of my head. I'd have to
      build that site to figure it out. I would think it's the same as using Itemid=345. If all else fails, Joomla will
      use the Home item's Itemid and all bets are off.</para>

      <para>Of course, this means that the same article can have three URLs, two of which are identical and one of them
      does not resolve to what you'd expect. But this is normal! And no, forget about getting a canonical URL for
      article C because there's none.</para>

      <para>This insanity cannot be addressed because it would require decoupling URL routing from Joomla's menu system.
      However, this would mean that all published modules appear in all pages as there is no longer a way to know which
      menu item you're in. Of course it's the solution to this problem which broke module display in our example above
      but this is what you get when the users are “crazy”.</para>

      <para>Or are they?</para>

      <para>While it sounds convoluted and problematic, this method is not the least bit more convoluted and problematic
      than any other given CMS <emphasis>when you take into account all the possible<footnote>
          <para>For any given, singular use case and a set of routing algorithms it is very easy to find the one
          algorithm which is most suitable, meaning the rest are unsuitable. However, every single use case has a
          different most suitable algorithm. Given a very large number of use cases, like the near infinite uses cases a
          CMS is called to address, any given routing algorithm would be just as unsuitable for most use cases as every
          other. Therefore the task of finding the “best” algorithm is reduced to finding an algorithm which fulfils
          some secondary or tertiary business goals such as making it possible for an end user to easily configure with
          a GUI or support our vision of having different modules show up in each page. The primary business goal of the
          “best” routing for the generic use case is, by definition, a bust unless we are willing to drastically reduce
          the use cases we are willing to support.</para>
        </footnote>, almost infinite use cases it's called to work with</emphasis>. It works great insofar the user can
      be trusted to not create psychopathic menu structures which work against the data structure, reusing the same
      aliases for a good measure of insanity.</para>

      <para>But why would any user even create such a menu structure to begin with?!</para>

      <para>As a matter of fact, the menu structure I presented <emphasis role="bold">is the wrong way to use
      Joomla</emphasis>. I confess I misdirected you but I did so for a noble reason. What the user most likely wanted
      was the menu item's <emphasis>visual</emphasis> structure to be what we presented for user experience reasons.
      They most likely don't care or not even <emphasis>want</emphasis> the crazy URL structure. They would very likely
      be spending hundreds of Euros every year in various SEF / SEO tools to try and fix their mistake… when they could
      just be told how to use Joomla the way Joomla was intended to be used to begin with.</para>

      <para>The One True Joomla Way™ is to use a “hidden” menu (a menu without a module to display it) to generate the
      URL structure in a way that's mostly following the data structure and a shown menu with Alias menu items for the
      visual display.</para>

      <para>So, in our example, the hidden menu would be:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Category A, alias <code>alpha</code>. Item ID 345.</para>

          <itemizedlist>

      <para>Do NOT try to address this in your router code; you will lose your mind and you will never make it work for

      <para>Instead, ask your user what is their <emphasis>use case</emphasis> and is <emphasis>their
      intention</emphasis> with their menu structure: are they trying to shape the URL structure or just the way things
      are presented on their site? In 99 out of 100 cases the user intended to affect only the visual presentation of
      the menu; they have no idea they are shooting their feet by affecting the URL structure. Patiently explain them
      the trick about hidden menus. You'll get grateful clients for life.</para>

      <title>Joomla 3 vs Joomla 4</title>

      <para>In Joomla 3 we would create a router as a <filename>router.php</filename> file in the root of our
      component's frontend, e.g. <filename>components/com_example/router.php</filename>. That file had two ways to
      implement a router:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Two separate functions whose names consisted of the name of the component without the <code>com_</code>
          prefix and the suffixes <code>BuildRoute</code> and <code>ParseRoute</code>, e.g.
          <function>exampleBuildRoute</function> and <function>exampleParseRoute</function>. This was the very old way
          which was deprecated since Joomla 3.3 released in 2014.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>As a class extending <classname>JComponentRouterBase</classname> (renamed to
          <classname>Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterBase</classname> in later Joomla versions) or, more usually,
          <classname>JComponentRouterView</classname> (introduced in Joomla 3.5 and renamed to
          <classname>Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterView</classname> in later Joomla versions).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If you are using the former method you have a lot of work ahead of you to convert it to a Joomla 4
      compatible router. If you are using the latter method you are virtually ready, with minimal changes!</para>

      <para>In Joomla 4 the router is implemented as the class <code>Service\Router</code> in the frontend part of our
      component. So, with a component <code>com_example</code> that has a namespace prefix
      <code>Acme\Component\Example</code> that would be the class
      <classname>Acme\Component\Example\Site\Service\Router</classname> in the file
      <filename>components/com_example/src/Service/Router.php</filename>. That class needs to extend from
      <classname>Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterBase</classname> or, more typically
      <classname>Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterView</classname>, just like in Joomla 3.5<footnote>
          <para>The entire concept of routing using the RouterView has not changed since Joomla 3.5 which was released
          in 2016. You see, at this point in time development of Joomla 4 had already started and Joomla introduced the
          new routing to help developers migrate their extensions to the new router before Joomla 4 is released.</para>
        </footnote> and later versions.</para>

      <para>There is one more difference in Joomla 4 and later versions. By default, the component does not know that it
      needs to use a router.</para>

      <para>To understand what and why we need to do, let's go backwards. Joomla only knows it needs to use a router
      factory when the component's extension class implements the
      <interfacename>\Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterServiceInterface</interfacename>. When this is the case, Joomla
      knows that it can ask the extension class to return a Router Factory object using the
      <methodname>createRouter</methodname> method defined in said interface. The component's extension class does not
      know how to find the router factory object; it is injected into it by the component service provider
      (<filename>services/provider.php</filename>). In its turn, it asks the component's DI Container for that Router
      Factory object. The DI Container will only know how to get a Router Factory object is we register a Router Factory
      service provider in the service provider (<filename>services/provider.php</filename>).</para>

      <para>Unraveling these chained dependencies we see that we need to make changes in just two files.</para>

      <para>Your component's extension class must implement the
      <interfacename>\Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterServiceInterface</interfacename> interface. The easiest way to
      provide its implementation is having it use the
      <classname>\Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterServiceTrait</classname> trait.</para>

      <para>That trait requires your component service provider (e.g.
      <filename>administrator/components/com_example/services/provider.php</filename>) to do two things. First, it needs
      to register a Router Factory service provider before trying to create the component object:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$container-&gt;registerServiceProvider(
  new \Joomla\CMS\Extension\Service\Provider\RouterFactory
  (
    '\\Acme\\Component\\Example'
  )
);</programlisting>

      <para>The <classname>\Joomla\CMS\Extension\Service\Provider\RouterFactory</classname> class is the default Joomla
      implementation of a component router factory. It needs exactly one configuration parameter in its constructor, the
      namespace of your component <emphasis>without</emphasis> the <code>Site</code> or <code>Administrator</code>
      suffix.</para>

      <para>Then, after having created our component extension class' object, we need to inject the Router Factory
      object into it:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$container-&gt;set(
  ComponentInterface::class,
  function (Container $container) {
    $component = new ExampleComponent(
      $container-&gt;get(ComponentDispatcherFactoryInterface::class)
    );

    // ... other initialisation goes here ...

    // Inject the router factory object
    <emphasis role="bold">$component-&gt;setRouterFactory(
      $container-&gt;get(
        \Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterFactoryInterface::class
      )
    );</emphasis>
  }
);</programlisting>

      <para>While it looks a bit verbose, it accomplishes two things. First, it's not possible to be surprised by Joomla
      magically implementing a feature in your component you did not expect. Second, in the case of a router, it allows
      us to <link linkend="com-router-push-dependencies">push dependencies (services) into our router
      object</link>.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-router-routerview">
      <title>Using RouterView</title>

      <para>If you are using a router class extending from <classname>Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterView</classname>
      it is fairly easy to create a router for most components.</para>

      <para>The constructor of your class tells Joomla which views of your component can be routed in the frontend and
      the relation to each other. For example:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">public function __construct(SiteApplication $app = null, AbstractMenu $menu = null)
{
  $welcome = new \Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterViewConfiguration('welcome');
  $this-&gt;registerView($welcome);

  $item = (new \Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterViewConfiguration('item'))
    -&gt;setKey('id')
    -&gt;addLayout('default')
    -&gt;addLayout('fancy');
  $this-&gt;registerView($item);

  $detail = (new \Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterViewConfiguration('detail'))
    -&gt;setKey('id')
    -&gt;setParent($item, 'itemid');
  $this-&gt;registerView($detail);

  parent::__construct($app, $menu);

  $this-&gt;attachRule(new \Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\Rules\MenuRules($this));
  $this-&gt;attachRule(new \Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\Rules\StandardRules($this));
  $this-&gt;attachRule(new \Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\Rules\NomenuRules($this));
}</programlisting>

      <para>This tells Joomla that we have three routable views called <code>welcome</code>, <code>item</code> and
      <code>detail</code>. The <code>detail</code> view is a child of <code>item</code>.</para>

      <para>How would Joomla know about which detail is under a specific item? We told it that the <code>detail</code>'s
      <code>itemid</code> property must match the key of the <code>item</code> and the key of the <code>item</code> is
      called <code>id</code>.</para>

      <para>The last three lines tell Joomla which routing rules to register:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><classname>MenuRules</classname>. Tries to detect the correct Itemid for a view if none was provided in
          the non-SEF URL. You should keep that unless you want to implement the <methodname>preprocess</methodname>
          method yourself.</para>

          <note>
            <para>The <methodname>preprocess</methodname> method is called before the SEF URL is built and, crucially,
            before Joomla tries to figure out the <code>format</code> and <code>Itemid</code> URL parameters to send to
            your component's Router's build method.</para>

            <para>In Joomla 3 you could get away with trying to figure out and change the <code>format</code> and
            <code>Itemid</code> parameters in your router's <methodname>build</methodname> method. While this was
            necessary for compatibility with legacy <filename>router.php</filename> files (those using the two distinct
            functions), <emphasis>this “hack” will no longer work in Joomla 4</emphasis>. You must move that code into
            the <methodname>preprocess</methodname> method. If you fail to do so, your SEF URLs will not work properly;
            from your perspective, it will be as if your <code>format</code> and <code>Itemid</code> values overridden
            in the built method were never taken into account. That's <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> what happens.</para>

            <para>This is actually a good change. It makes the core routing code more efficient and keeps us third party
            developers in the habit of applying separation of concerns in our code.</para>
          </note>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><classname>StandardRules</classname>. Standard non-SEF to SEF URL (and vice-versa) routing. If you omit
          this you will not get any SEF URL routing which beats the purpose of having a router.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><classname>NomenuRules</classname>. Process URLs when no Itemid exists for the component. This is
          necessary to route URLs when no published menu items exist for your component and Joomla needs to create or
          parse URLs in the format <uri>/component/example/foo/bar.html</uri>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>At this point Joomla knows the logical hierarchy of our component's views but it does not know how to
      convert an id in the non-SEF URL to a SEF URL segment when building the SEF URL (e.g. convert an item ID to its
      alias) or how to convert a SEF URL segment back to a non-SEF URL's numeric ID when it's parsing the SEF URL (e.g.
      convert an item alias to its ID). This is up to us.</para>

      <para>We need to provide two methods for each <classname>RouterViewConfiguration</classname> objects we created:
      <methodname>get<replaceable>Something</replaceable>Segment</methodname> and
      <methodname>get<replaceable>Something</replaceable>Id</methodname> where <replaceable>Something</replaceable> is
      the name of the view with its first letter capitalised. Here's what the code for the Item view would look like in
      our example:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">public function getItemId(string $segment, array $query): bool|int
{
  $db = \Joomla\CMS\Factory::getContainer()-&gt;get('DatabaseDriver');
  $dbQuery = $db-&gt;getQuery(true)
    -&gt;select($db-&gt;quoteName('id'))
    -&gt;from($db-&gt;quoteName('#__example_items'))
    -&gt;where($db-&gt;quoteName('alias') . ' = :alias')
    -&gt;bind(':alias', $segment);

    return  $db-&gt;setQuery($dbQuery)-&gt;loadResult() ?: false;
  }

  public function getItemSegment(int $id, array $query): array
  {
    $db = \Joomla\CMS\Factory::getContainer()-&gt;get('DatabaseDriver');
    $dbQuery = $db-&gt;getQuery(true)
      -&gt;select($db-&gt;quoteName('alias'))
      -&gt;from($db-&gt;quoteName('#__example_items'))
      -&gt;where($db-&gt;quoteName('id') . ' = :id')
      -&gt;bind(':id', $id);

    $segment = $db-&gt;setQuery($dbQuery)-&gt;loadResult() ?: null;

    if ($segment === null) {
      return [];
    }

    return [$segment];
  }</programlisting>

      <para>There is something worth noting here. The
      <methodname>get<replaceable>Something</replaceable>Segment</methodname> method can return an array with more than
      one segments. This is useful if you want to somehow return a more complex structure e.g.
      <uri>item/foo/detail/bar</uri> where <code>item</code> and <code>detail</code> are fixed strings. However, if you
      do that, you will need to override the <methodname>parse</methodname> method to handle multi-segment views. The
      default implementation in <classname>StandardRules</classname> assumes that you are using exactly one segment per
      view and that's why <methodname>get<replaceable>Something</replaceable>Id</methodname> accepts a string, not an
      array, as its first argument.</para>

      <para>You may wonder, what about our <code>welcome</code> view? Don't we need to create methods for it? No, we
      don't. Views which do not have a key set for them use the name of the view as the (only) segment for SEF URLs. If
      there is a naming clash between such a view and an alias of a top-level view (or category, as we will see below)
      the first <classname>RouterViewConfiguration</classname> object registered “wins” in determining how that segment
      should be parsed. As a result, you should keep this kind of top-level views to a minimum and either inform users
      that they cannot use these aliases or actively prevent them with validation rules whenever possible.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-router-push-dependencies">
      <title>Pushing dependencies to the Router</title>

      <para>You may have noticed that in the sample code above I got the database driver object using the
      <methodname>Factory::getContainer</methodname> static method. This is not ideal. It's even worse if I'd need to
      get access to MVC objects such as Models and Tables — having to boot the entire component just to get its
      MVCFactory is something to use only if there is no other way, not something to do by default.</para>

      <para>Fortunately, Joomla gives us the option to push any services we need — such as the database driver object
      and the component's MVCFactory — into the router. Unfortunately, it's a bit non-obvious.</para>

      <para>To inject services into the Router service object they need to be injected into the object after it is
      created by the Router Factory object. The Router Factory object needs to have access to these services to inject
      them. This means injecting these services to the Router Factory object from the Router Factory Service Provider.
      The Router Factory Service Provider can get any of the dependencies (services) it needs since it has access to the
      component's service provider.</para>

      <para>Therefore we need to create the two missing pieces of the puzzle (Router Factory and its service provider)
      and register the latter with our component's service provider.</para>

      <important>
        <para>The component's service provider (<filename>services/provider.php</filename>) lives in the backend portion
        of your component. Therefore. it makes sense that the Router Factory and the Router Factory Service Provider
        also live in the backend of your component <emphasis>even though the Router is only used in the frontend of the
        site</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>Yup. It sounds backwards. You can definitely create them in the frontend but, if you do,
        <emphasis>you</emphasis> and everyone else reading your code might get confused. Don't over-think it, just do
        what I tell you to do. There's method in this madness, I promise.</para>
      </important>

      <para>First, let's make our router MVCFactory-aware (it's already database-aware).</para>

      <programlisting language="php">&lt;?php
namespace Acme\Component\Example\Site\Service;

use Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterView;
use Joomla\CMS\MVC\Factory\MVCFactoryAwareTrait;

class Router extends RouterView
{<emphasis role="bold">
  use MVCFactoryAwareTrait;
                </emphasis>
  // ... the rest of the router implementation goes here ...
}</programlisting>

      <para>Now, let's create a Router Factory
      (<classname>\Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Service\RouterFactory</classname>). The default Joomla
      implementation is already database-aware. I am just extending it to also know about the MVCFactory so we can
      inject it to our router.</para>

      <programlisting language="php">&lt;?php
namespace Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Service;

use Joomla\CMS\Application\CMSApplicationInterface;
use Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterInterface;
use Joomla\CMS\Menu\AbstractMenu;
use Joomla\CMS\MVC\Factory\MVCFactoryAwareTrait;

class RouterFactory extends \Joomla\CMS\Component\Router\RouterFactory
{
  use MVCFactoryAwareTrait;

  public function createRouter(CMSApplicationInterface $application, AbstractMenu $menu): RouterInterface
  {
    $router = parent::createRouter($application, $menu);

    $router-&gt;setMVCFactory($this-&gt;getMVCFactory());

    return $router;
  }
}</programlisting>

      <para>Now, we need to create a RouterFactory service provider. Unfortunately, Joomla has a bad habit of
      registering factory objects in the DI container even though they are only going to return exactly one object with
      no initialisation, like a router. This complicates thing because we cannot extend the DI container definition. We
      have to do something stupid: copy Joomla's default implementation of the Router Factory Service Provider just so
      we can change the returned object type and register dependencies on it. Well... I guess it could be worse?</para>

      <para>Anyway. Let's create our router factory service provider
      <classname>\Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Service\Provider\RouterFactoryProvider</classname>.</para>

      <programlisting language="php">&lt;?php
namespace \Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Service\Provider;

  public function register(Container $container)
  {
    $container-&gt;set(
      RouterFactoryInterface::class,
      function (Container $container) {
        $categoryFactory = null;

        if ($container-&gt;has(CategoryFactoryInterface::class))
        {
          $categoryFactory = $container-&gt;get(CategoryFactoryInterface::class);
        }

        $routerFactory = new <emphasis role="bold">RouterFactory</emphasis>(
          $this-&gt;namespace,

  }
}            </programlisting>

      <para>Our changes to the core code in Joomla are highlighted in bold type.</para>

      <para>Finally, we need to register this router factory service provider in our component's
      <code>services/provider.php</code> file.</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$container-&gt;registerServiceProvider(

  )
);</programlisting>

  <section xml:id="com-dashboard">
    <title>Dashboard</title>

    <para>There is a new feature starting with Joomla 4: Dashboards.</para>

    <para>Dashboards are sort of virtual pages, displayed by means of the com_cpanel core component, <link
    xlink:href="https://magazine.joomla.org/all-issues/april-2021/joomla-4-customising-admin-dashboards">which allow the
    developer and the site owners to publish modules to customise them</link>.</para>

    <bridgehead>Define a dashboard</bridgehead>

    <para>You can define one or more dashboards in your component's XML manifest file:</para>

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;dashboards&gt;
  &lt;dashboard title="COM_EXAMPLE_DASHBOARD_TITLE" icon="none fa fa-beer"&gt;com_example.something&lt;/dashboard&gt;
&lt;/dashboards&gt;</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para><code>&lt;dashboards&gt;</code> is a top-level tag, directly under the <code>&lt;extension&gt;</code> root
      tag. Yes, even though it only applies in the component's administration (backend) section. If your Dashboard does
      not work first check that you have not accidentally put that tag under <code>&lt;administration&gt;</code>. It's
      the most common mistake!</para>
    </note>

    <para>The <code>title</code> attribute's value is a language string defined in your extension's backend INI language
    file. It's customary for its string to end with the word “Dashboard”, e.g.</para>

    <programlisting language="ini">COM_EXAMPLE_DASHBOARD_TITLE="Example Dashboard"</programlisting>

    <para>The value of the <code>icon</code> attribute is a CSS class which gives the dashboard page its icon. Joomla 4
    loads FontAwesome 5 Free so you can use <link xlink:href="https://fontawesome.com/v5/search?o=r&amp;m=free">any of
    its icons</link>. Please remember that Joomla prefixes the value of the <code>icon</code> attribute with the string
    literal <code>icon-</code>. This does not let you use all FontAwesome icons. To work around that I use the value
    <code>none fa fa-beer</code> which results in the HTML attribute and value <code>class="icon-none fa
    fa-beer"</code>. Since <code>icon-none</code> does not display anything, the browser falls back to the next two CSS
    classes which render FontAwesome's beer mug icon.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>The Dashboard is not part of your component. It does not load any custom backend CSS you may have. As a
      result, you cannot display your logo or any custom image in the Dashboard. While you could do that by loading
      custom CSS in a module you set up in the dashboard, do keep in mind that the user can easily disable (unpublish)
      that module and then your CSS won't load anymore. If you opt for this trick it's a good idea to provide a fallback
      to a Joomla system icon class or a FontAwesome icon class to make sure that <emphasis>something</emphasis> is
      displayed as the Dashboard's title icon.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>The value inside the tag <emphasis>must</emphasis> be in the format <code>component.something</code> where
    component is the name of your component (e.g. <code>com_example</code>) and something is a unique identifier for the
    dashboard among all dashboards defined in your component. For example, we could have the dashboard
    <code>com_example.something</code>.</para>

    <important>
      <para>Your component manifest MUST ALSO follow the naming convention <filename>bareComponent.xml</filename> and be
      placed in the backend folder of your component. For example, <code>com_example</code>'s XML manifest MUST be
      called <filename>example.xml</filename> and be found in
      administrator/components/com_example/<filename>example.xml</filename>.</para>

      <para>Keep in mind that Joomla automatically copies your component's XML manifest to the backend of your site when
      installing the component. You will only ever have to do it manually — if ever — when developing a component
      locally.</para>
    </important>

    <para>The value of the tag after the dot is also important. All modules published to the module position
    <code>cpanel-<replaceable>com_example</replaceable>-<replaceable>something</replaceable></code> will appear in this
    dashboard <code>com_example.something</code>.</para>

    <bridgehead>Display a link to your dashboard in the component's submenu</bridgehead>

    <para>The dashboard is cool… but how do you even display it? As it turns out there are exactly two ways:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Put a link (e.g. a Toolbar link button) in your extension pointing the browser to
        <uri>index.php?index.php?option=com_cpanel&amp;view=cpanel&amp;dashboard=<replaceable>com_example.something</replaceable></uri>
        where <replaceable>com_example.something</replaceable> is your custom dashboard.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Add a submenu item in your XML manifest, e.g.</para>

        <programlisting language="xml">&lt;menu&gt;COM_EXAMPLE&lt;/menu&gt;

&lt;submenu&gt;
<emphasis role="bold">  &lt;menu
    link="index.php?option=com_cpanel&amp;amp;view=cpanel&amp;amp;dashboard=<replaceable>com_example.something</replaceable>"&gt;
    <replaceable>COM_EXAMPLE_MENU_TITLE_DASHBOARD</replaceable>
  &lt;/menu&gt;</emphasis>

  &lt;!-- more submenu items --&gt;
&lt;/submenu&gt;</programlisting>

        <important>
          <para>Remember that the <replaceable>COM_EXAMPLE_MENU_TITLE_DASHBOARD</replaceable> language string must be
          defined in your component's <filename>.sys.ini</filename> language file.</para>
        </important>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Super ultra secret stuff!</emphasis> Tell Joomla to display a Dashboard link next to
        your component's top-level menu entry. In your XML manifest you need to modify your top level menu item like
        so:</para>

        <programlisting language="xml">&lt;menu&gt;
  <emphasis role="bold">&lt;params&gt;
    &lt;dashboard&gt;com_example.something&lt;/dashboard&gt;
  &lt;/params&gt;</emphasis>
  COM_EXAMPLE
&lt;/menu&gt;

&lt;submenu&gt;
  &lt;!-- your submenu items here… --&gt;
&lt;/submenu&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>The contents of the <code>params</code> menu subkey in the XML manifest goes through Joomla's Registry
        object and ends up, serialised as JSON, in the <database>#__menu</database> table record's
        <database>params</database> column. The <code>dashboard</code> key tells Joomla to display a dashboard link next
        to the menu item's text. Its value tells Joomla <emphasis>which</emphasis> dashboard to link to.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>It is actually a good idea using a combination of the methods above. The toolbar link can help lost users find
    their way back to the dashboard. While the <code>params</code> trick is cool, it only works in the default
    components side menu. If the user has customised the menu, uses an alternative presentation or simply visits the
    Components Dashboard they won't see the link to your component's custom dashboard, therefore you may need the second
    method (the submenu link to your dashboard) to cater for these use cases. What can I say? Joomla is customisable.
    Maybe even a bit <emphasis>too</emphasis> customisable.</para>

    <bridgehead>A custom menu preset for your dashboard</bridgehead>

    <para>You may have noticed that all core dashboards seem to have an “immutable” area at the top. This is not
    immutable; it's just a plain old module of the type <code>mod_submenu</code> set to display in the module style
    <code>none</code> (that's why you don't see the cogs button to edit it in the dashboard). You can of course edit
    this module like any other module in Content, Administrator Modules.</para>

    <para>It's useful that we can also do the same for our own component and its dashboard. However, you may notice that
    mod_submenu only has presets for core components. What about our custom component? Well, as it turns out, there are
    no hardcoded presets! Everything you see available in mod_submenu is, in fact, file on your site and yes, we can do
    the same thing for our own component!</para>

    <para>We need to create a custom menu preset for our component by creating an XML file under the
    <filename>administrator/components/com_example/presets</filename> folder. To get an idea of what you can do, take a
    look at a core preset such as <filename>administrator/components/com_users/presets/users.xml</filename>.</para>

    <para>The name of your menu preset XML file MUST be unique across all components installed in Joomla. For this
    reason it's recommended to name it after your extension. For example, com_example's menu preset would be
    <filename>administrator/components/com_example/presets/example.xml</filename>.</para>

    <para>If you need multiple presets in your component it's strongly recommended that their file names follow the
    pattern <filename>component_something.xml</filename>, e.g.
    <filename>administrator/components/com_example/presets/example_alternate.xml</filename>.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>Per-component menu presets can be overridden in the same way as view templates. For example, if you want to
      override the default core Users menu preset
      (<filename>administrator/components/com_users/presets/users.xml</filename>), copy it to
      <filename>administrator/templates/atum/html/com_menus/presets/users.xml</filename> and edit away!</para>

      <para>Since all overrides live under the same <filename>com_menus/presets</filename> override folder you now
      understand why their name needs to be unique across all components installed on your site.</para>
    </tip>

    <para>Here is a sample preset, let's say it's
    <filename>administrator/components/com_example/presets/example.xml</filename> (this means the preset name is
    <code>example</code>) .</para>

    <para>Here are some <emphasis role="bold">practical</emphasis> tips:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The icon attribute sets the CSS class for the heading by combining the literal string <code>icon-</code>
        with the value of the attribute. The number of icons available that way is minuscule compared to the plethora of
        icons available in FontAwesome 5 Free. This is why I use values for this attribute in the form <code>none
        fa-something</code>. This results in the CSS class being set to <code>icon-none fa-something</code>. There is no
        such thing as an <code>icon-none</code> CSS class, so that part does nothing. The next part, the
        <code>fa-something</code>, is where I tell the browser to use one of the available FontAwesome icons.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <code>quicktask</code> and <code>quicktask-title</code> attributes set up the little quick action icon
        next to the menu item text. By default, this is a plus icon, implying that you can add an item. You can
        customise that icon using the attribute <code>menu-quicktask-icon</code> which works in the exact same way as a
        heading's <code>icon</code> attribute.</para>

        <para>Why would you want to customise it? Well, let's say you have a security component with a view called
        Automatically Blocked IP Addresses. It would not make sense to manually add a new entry — since they are
        <emphasis>automatically</emphasis> blocked — but it would totally make sense to have a quick action to
        <emphasis>unblock</emphasis> an accidentally blocked IP address. In this case a more appropriate icon would be
        <code>fa-unlock</code>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <bridgehead>Creating and publishing the custom dashboard menu module, automatically</bridgehead>

    <para>All right. We have a dashboard. We have a menu item to access it. We have a custom menu to display in a
    mod_submenu module inside the dashboard. But how exactly do we get to create this kind of module? We can't possibly
    ask our users to create it manually, that would suck!</para>

    <para>The answer is that Joomla gives us ALMOST everything we need to create that module in our component's
    installation script.</para>

    <para>First, let's make sure our component does use an installation script. In the XML manifest we need to add a
    line like this, as we're familiar from Joomla 3:</para>

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;scriptfile&gt;script.example.php&lt;/scriptfile&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>The <code>script.example.php</code> will contain our component installation script. You are familiar with
    that; it's been around since Joomla 1.0.</para>

    <para>What you may not have picked up is that since Joomla 3.6 there's a superclass our installation script can
    extend from. In Joomla 3 it was called <classname>JInstallerScript</classname>, in Joomla 4 it's
    <classname>Joomla\CMS\Installer\InstallerScript</classname> (the old name will work up to and including Joomla 5.3).
    We'll get into more detail on it <link linkend="com-installation-script">in the installation script
    section</link>.</para>

    <para>Joomla's InstallerScript provides a handy method called <methodname>addDashboardMenu</methodname> which
    creates a <code>mod_submenu</code> module to a specific dashboard using a specific menu preset. However, the way it
    is written it assumes that it will only ever be executed once, the first time you install a component. What about
    hundreds of third party components which have been around long before Joomla 4? Don't worry, we have a solution! We
    will install the module if and only if it's missing, regardless of whether this is a new installation or an
    update.</para>

    <para>Here's how to do that:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">&lt;?php
defined('_JEXEC') || die;

use Joomla\CMS\Factory;
use Joomla\CMS\Installer\Adapter\PackageAdapter;
use Joomla\CMS\Installer\InstallerScript;

   * @since   1.0.0

  public function postflight(string $type, PackageAdapter $parent): bool
  {
    // Do not run on uninstall.
    if ($type === 'uninstall')
    {
      return true;
    }

    // Install the dashboard module if necessary
    $this-&gt;conditionalInstallDashboard(<emphasis role="bold">'com-example-example', 'example'</emphasis>);

    return true;
  }

  private function conditionalInstallDashboard(string $dashboard, string $preset): void
  {
    $position = 'cpanel-' . $dashboard;

    /** @var \Joomla\Database\DatabaseDriver $db */
    $db = Factory::getContainer()-&gt;get('DatabaseDriver');
    $query = $db-&gt;getQuery(true)
      -&gt;select('COUNT(*)')
      -&gt;from($db-&gt;quoteName('#__modules'))
      -&gt;where([
        $db-&gt;quoteName('module') . ' = ' . $db-&gt;quote('mod_submenu'),
        $db-&gt;quoteName('client_id') . ' = ' . $db-&gt;quote(1),
        $db-&gt;quoteName('position') . ' = :position',
      ])
      -&gt;bind(':position', $position);

      $modules = $db-&gt;setQuery($query)-&gt;loadResult() ?: 0;

      if ($modules == 0)
      {
        $this-&gt;addDashboardMenu($dashboard, $preset);
      }
    }
  }</programlisting>

    <para>The <methodname>postflight</methodname> method is called whenever Joomla has finished trying to install
    <emphasis>or uninstall</emphasis> (in Joomla 3 it was only after installation!) our component and before it cleans
    up. At this point we can check if there is a module already installed. If not, we let Joomla's code install
    it.</para>

    <para>The only two things you need to change above are the parts in bold type: the class name to match your
    component's name and the parameters to the <methodname>conditionalInstallDashboard</methodname> method. The
    parameters are fairly obvious: the name of the dashboard (replacing the underscore and dot with a dash!) and the
    name of your menu preset which typically is the same as your component's name without the <code>com_</code>
    prefix.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>You can publish modules to your Dashboards by assigning them to a module position named something like
      <code>cpanel-com-<replaceable>example</replaceable>-<replaceable>something</replaceable></code> where
      <replaceable>example</replaceable> is the name of your component without <code>com_</code> and
      <replaceable>something</replaceable> is the name of your custom dashboard without the component prefix. The
      aforementioned example module corresponds to the dashboard <code>com_example.something</code>.</para>

      <para>Likewise, Quick Icon modules can be assigned to a custom dashboard by publishing them to the module position
      <code>icon-com-<replaceable>example</replaceable>-<replaceable>something</replaceable></code> following the same
      convention as above (you just replace <code>cpanel</code> with <code>icon</code>). Remember that Quick Icon
      modules are displayed <emphasis>above</emphasis> the other dashboard modules.</para>

              <para><code>install</code>. The extension is being installed from a package uploaded via the browser, a

    <classname>Joomla\CMS\Installer\InstallerScript</classname> (the old name will work up to and including Joomla 5.3).
    When your script extends from this class you can unlock a lot of useful functionality.</para>

      I moved all my development to Joomla core MVC. The fork was contributed by George Wilson in 2016 — he had already
      asked me for permission to fork some useful bits of FOF 2 as it was going to be EOL in June that year. Just an
      aside, so that you know that Joomla and 3PDs have a symbiotic relationship; <emphasis>we help each other
      survive</emphasis>.</para>
    </note>

    <bridgehead>Minimum Joomla and PHP versions</bridgehead>

    <para>The installation script can automatically enforce a minimum Joomla and / or PHP version for your extension. If
    the minimum requirements are not met the installation or upgrade will abort with the aforementioned error. You can
    do that by setting the relevant properties in your class:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">// The extension will only install on PHP 8.0.0 or later
protected $minimumPhp = '8.0.0';

// The extension will only install on Joomla 4.2.0 or later
protected $minimumJoomla = '4.2.0';</programlisting>

    <bridgehead>Handling downgrades</bridgehead>

    <para>As mentioned earlier, Joomla uses the term “upgrade” very loosely. If you install any version of your
    extension while another (or the same!) version is already installed Joomla will happily oblige and call it an
    “upgrade”. However, most extensions cannot <emphasis>downgrade</emphasis> cleanly, i.e. going from version 2.0.0 to
    version 1.9.3 may not work at all. This makes perfect sense. You cannot possibly travel back in time to update the
    installation script of your extension's older versions to make a downgrade possible — if it's even at all possible.
    Therefore, <emphasis role="bold">by default, the installation script will prevent downgrades</emphasis>. Users can
    only install the same or a newer version of your software.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>Preventing downgrades will only work properly if your extension uses <link
      xlink:href="https://semver.org">Semantic Versioning (SemVer)</link>. Your development / nightly releases must
      additionally follow <link xlink:href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.version-compare.php">PHP's versioning
      rules</link>. That is to say, a development / nightly release coming after the official release of version 1.2.3
      must be named something like 1.2.<emphasis role="bold">4</emphasis>-dev-20220914.</para>

    <para>There are cases where you might not want to do that. Simpler extensions may support downgrades, or you may
    have implemented some solution which allows you to perform downgrades (e.g. you may have added a custom file in
    every new release to handle downgrades to a previous version). Or you may just not use semantic versioning and you'd
    rather implement your custom logic to determine when something is a downgrade or not. In this case set this in your
    installer class:</para>

    <bridgehead>Removing obsolete folders and files</bridgehead>

    <para>As we progress through versions of our software we have to contend with the fact that some code becomes
    obsolete and needs to be removed, Joomla has changed leading to moved files, or we might even need to refactor code
    and move things around. This means that we have files and folders which need to be removed on upgrade.</para>

    <para>Joomla will automatically remove folders and files explicitly listed in the XML manifest of the installed
    version but not on the new version's XML manifest. This means that only, for example, top level component folders
    are removed on update. If you have a few specific files, e.g. some obsolete view template files, or folders deeper
    inside the directory structure they will not be automatically removed.</para>

    <para>The $deleteFiles and $deleteFolders properties allow you to specify which files and folders need to be
    removed, if they exist, on update. For example:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">protected $deleteFiles = [
  JPATH_SITE . '/components/com_example/tmpl/welcome/default_donate.php',
  JPATH_ADMINISTRATOR . '/components/com_example/tmpl/item/default_phpwarning.php',
];

protected $deleteFolders = [
  JPATH_SITE . '/media/com_example/icons',
];</programlisting>

    <title>Component menus</title>

    <para>When we are talking about component menus, what comes in mind? Usually it's just the user's ability to create
    menu items to specific views of your component in the frontend of the site.</para>

    <para>Joomla components are much more than that. To begin with, the XML manifest defines the default component menu
    and its submenu items. As we've already learned, this can be augmented with customisable Dashboards (introduced in
    Joomla 4.0) to help site integrators tailor the backend experience of their clients as they wish. Ever <link
    xlink:href="https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5664-joomla-3-6-is-here.html">since Joomla 3.6</link>
    it's possible to apply permissions (ACL rules) to backend menu items to modify the submenu items in a way which
    makes more sense depending on who is logged in.</para>

    <para>Moreover, ever <link
    xlink:href="https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5703-joomla-3-7-is-here.html">since Joomla 3.7</link>,
    it is possible to have a custom backend menus. This is one more way for site integrators to fully customise the
    backend experience of their clients, using menu titles which make sense in the business context they are going to be
    used instead of the much drier, purely functional and very technical language core Joomla and us third party
    developers use.</para>

    <para>All these features are linked to and defined by the components installed on the site, core and third party.
    Let's see how you can make the magic happen.</para>

    <section xml:id="com-menus-component">
      <title>The default component menu</title>

      <para>The default component menu is what appears in Joomla's main menu (the sidebar) under the Components menu
      item. You define this menu in your component's XML manifest, under the <code>&lt;administration&gt;</code>
      section. Joomla <link xlink:href="https://docs.joomla.org/Manifest_files#Menu_Links_and_Submenus">has some partial
      documentation</link> on how that works.</para>

      <para>At the very least, every component needs to have the top level item, a <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> tag
      directly under the <code>&lt;administration&gt;</code> section. This controls how your component will appear in
      the <guimenu>Components</guimenu> menu.</para>

      <para>If you want a sub-menu under your top level item you need to also add a <code>&lt;submenu&gt;</code> tag at
      the same level as the <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> tag. Unlike the menu tag, this one does not have any attributes.
      However, it can contain one or more <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> tags, one per sub-menu item.</para>

      <important>
        <para>If you define a sub-menu then the top level menu item becomes a toggle for the sub-menu and cannot be
        clicked. For this reason you will have to duplicate the top level link as a sub-menu item.</para>
      </important>

      <note>
        <para>It is possible to have third (or more) level sub-menus by nesting <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> tags.
        <emphasis>Just because you can doesn't mean you should</emphasis>. Multi-level menus are user-hostile,
        especially when the available width to display their label is ever shrinking the deeper you go into the menu
        structure.</para>

        <para>If you find yourself even considering a multi-level menu, you're doing something wrong. Try creating a
        dashboard instead or otherwise group the functionality of your component so it doesn't rely on a byzantine menu
        structure.</para>
      </note>

      <para>A very simple extension menu would look like this in your XML manifest (as per the Joomla
      documentation):</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;menu&gt;COM_EXAMPLE&lt;/menu&gt;
&lt;submenu&gt;
  &lt;!--
  Note that all &amp; must be escaped to &amp;amp; for the file to be valid
  XML and be parsed by the installer
  --&gt;
  &lt;menu link="anoption=avalue&amp;amp;anoption1=avalue1"&gt;COM_EXAMPLE_SUBMENU_ANOPTION&lt;/menu&gt;
  &lt;menu view="viewname"&gt;COM_EXAMPLE_SUBMENU_VIEWNAME&lt;/menu&gt;
&lt;/submenu&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>This does not tell you the whole truth and is actually a partial, confusing and harmful representation of
      what Joomla can do. Here is a more realistic example:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;menu&gt;
  &lt;params&gt;
    &lt;dashboard&gt;com_example.something&lt;/dashboard&gt;
  &lt;/params&gt;
  COM_EXAMPLE
&lt;/menu&gt;

&lt;submenu&gt;
&lt;!--
Note that all &amp; must be escaped to &amp;amp; for the file to be valid
XML and be parsed by the installer
--&gt;
  &lt;menu view="welcome"&gt;COM_EXAMPLE_MENUS_WELCOME&lt;/menu&gt;

  &lt;menu link="index.php?option=com_categories&amp;amp;extension=com_example"&gt;
    &lt;params&gt;
      &lt;menu-permission&gt;core.manage;com_categories&lt;/menu-permission&gt;
      &lt;menu-quicktask&gt;index.php?option=com_categories&amp;amp;task=category.add&amp;amp;extension=com_example&lt;/menu-quicktask&gt;
      &lt;menu-quicktask-title&gt;COM_EXAMPLE_MENUS_ADD_CATEGORY&lt;/menu-quicktask-title&gt;
      &lt;menu-quicktask-permission&gt;core.create;com_categories&lt;/menu-quicktask-permission&gt;
    &lt;/params&gt;
    JCATEGORIES
  &lt;/menu&gt;

  &lt;menu view="items"&gt;
    &lt;params&gt;
      &lt;menu-permission&gt;core.manage;com_example&lt;/menu-permission&gt;
      &lt;menu-quicktask&gt;index.php?option=com_example&amp;amp;task=item.add&lt;/menu-quicktask&gt;
      &lt;menu-quicktask-title&gt;COM_EXAMPLE_MENUS_ADD_ITEM&lt;/menu-quicktask-title&gt;
      &lt;menu-quicktask-permission&gt;core.create;com_example&lt;/menu-quicktask-permission&gt;
    &lt;/params&gt;
    COM_EXAMPLE_MENUS_ITEMS
  &lt;/menu&gt;
&lt;/submenu&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Woah! It's pretty substantially different. This is a better example because it shows you all the interesting
      and insanely powerful things you can do with the humble component menu. Let's take it easy, break it down to
      individual bits and pieces and it will all become crystal clear, I promise!</para>

      <bridgehead>An x-ray of the <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> tag</bridgehead>

      <para>Every <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> tag consist of:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Zero or more attributes. These determine what kind of link the rendered menu item will produce.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A single, but optional ,<code>&lt;params&gt;</code> element with one or more child elements. These are
          menu parameters which are used to define menu item access (ACL permissions), whether the menu item should
          display a Dashboard link and whether the menu item should display a quick action button next to it.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Text content, e.g. <code>COM_EXAMPLE_MENUS_WELCOME</code>. This is a language string which is used to
          translate the menu item's title in the user's language.</para>

          <note>
            <para>The language strings for the component menu items' titles are in the backend system language file,
            i.e. <filename>com_example.sys.ini</filename> for a <code>com_example</code> component.</para>
          </note>

          <warning>
            <para>Do <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> use <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags
            in your language strings to display icons. <emphasis>Some major Joomla extension developers should know
            better than do that, and yet…</emphasis></para>

            <para>There are the <code>menu_icon</code> and <code>menu_image</code> parameters to do that correctly, if
            you really need to. Using a tag at the beginning of your language string breaks alphabetical sorting of the
            Components menu, making it much harder for end users to navigate it. Finally, as we will see further below,
            using iconography in menus is a bad idea anyway.</para>
          </warning>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <bridgehead>The <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> attributes</bridgehead>

      <para>Each menu tag can have a combination of the following attributes:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>type</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Normally not set. You can set it to <code>separator</code>. In this case do <emphasis
            role="bold">not</emphasis> set a <code>link</code> or <code>view</code> attribute; the text content of the
            menu item will be rendered as a non-linked header in the menu structure.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>target</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Only applies if you are using the <code>link</code> attribute. Corresponds to the
            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> HTML tag's <code>target</code> attribute. Useful if you want to create a menu item
            linking to an external site and you'd like to open it in a new tab / window; in this case set
            <code>target="_blank"</code>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>link</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>A link the browser will navigate to. You should ideally only use this to point to pages of components
            other than yours, e.g. <uri>index.php?option=com_categories&amp;extension=com_example</uri> to display the
            categories management interface through Joomla's <code>com_categories</code> core component.</para>

            <para>Note that a link pointing to another page in the site's backend is relative to
            <uri>/administrator</uri>. <emphasis>Do not</emphasis> put <uri>/administrator</uri> in front, though; this
            would break the menu for sites which are installed in subdirectories.</para>

            <para>This attribute is mutually exclusive with <code>view</code>. If both are set, <code>link</code> will
            be applied.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>view</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>The view of the current component you want to link to.</para>

            <para>For example, if we are in the XML manifest of the <code>com_example</code> component and you set
            <code>view="welcome"</code> it's the same as if you had used
            <code>link="index.php?option=com_example&amp;view=welcome"</code>.</para>

            <para>This attribute is mutually exclusive with <code>link</code>. If both are set, <code>link</code> will
            be applied.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>ajaxbadge</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>While you will normally only see that in menu presets used in Dashboards, this is perfectly supported
            in the component's menu as well.</para>

            <para>When set, a badge will appear next to the title. Joomla will perform an AJAX request to the URL
            provided in the value of this attribute. This URL is supposed to return a JSON document with the following
            keys:</para>

            <programlisting language="json">{
  "success": true,
  "error": "",
  "data": "something"
}</programlisting>

            <para>If the <code>success</code> key is true Joomla will take the <code>data</code> key's value, sanitise
            its HTML (only allowing a subset of tags and attributes you can find in the
            <filename>build/media_source/system/js/core.es6.js</filename> file in Joomla's repository) and put that
            sanitised HTML in the badge.</para>

            <para>This is typically used to display the number of items which require attention.</para>

            <warning>
              <para>Do not go overboard with this feature! This AJAX request will run on every page of your site's
              backend, slowing everything down. I have not yet seen a <emphasis>practical</emphasis> use case where this
              is even remotely acceptable.</para>
            </warning>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>Despite what the Joomla documentation wants you to believe, there is neither an <code>alt</code> nor an
      <code>img</code> attribute; these existed in Joomla 2.5 and earlier. But there are so many more attributes not
      mentioned in there.</para>

      <bridgehead>The &lt;menu&gt; parameters</bridgehead>

      <para>As we mentioned earlier, the <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> tag can include an optional
      <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> tag which, in its turn, contains a number of tags. Everything under
      <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> is parsed as parameters to the menu item. The tag name is the parameter key and its
      contents is the parameter's value.</para>

      <para>Here are the supported tag names I've discovered by reverse-engineering the code of the backend
      <code>mod_menu</code> module:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>dashboard</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>If set, it creates a dashboard icon next to the menu item's title, linking to the named
            dashboard.</para>

            <para>Example: <code>&lt;dashboard&gt;com_example.example&lt;/dashboard&gt;</code>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>menu-permission</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>The Joomla ACL permission the user needs to have to see this menu item (and all its sub-items, if
            any).</para>

            <para>To use global permissions (set in the Permissions tab of Global Configuration) use the format
            <code>&lt;menu-permission&gt;core.manage&lt;/menu-permission&gt;</code></para>

            <para>To use component-level permissions (set in the Permissions tab of a component) use the format
            <code>&lt;menu-permission&gt;core.manage;com_example&lt;/menu-permission&gt;</code></para>

            <para>You can NOT ask Joomla to combine multiple permissions i.e. you cannot ask it to only display a menu
            item if two or more permissions are simultaneously granted; or if one of several permissions is granted. The
            reason for that can be found in the code of
            <code>\Joomla\Module\Submenu\Administrator\Menu\Menu::preprocess</code>.</para>

        </varlistentry>

          <term>menu-quicktask</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Menu items can have an optional “quick task” shown next to them. This is a small button with an icon
            and no visible text (the text is only made available to users of assistive technologies for accessibility
            reasons). The value of this parameter is the URL to visit when the quick task button is used. It follows the
            same rules as the <code>link</code> attribute.</para>

            <para>Example:
            <code>&lt;menu-quicktask&gt;index.php?option=com_example&amp;amp;task=item.add&lt;/menu-quicktask&gt;</code></para>

            <note>
              <para>While this is <emphasis>typically</emphasis> used to render a [+] icon button to add new items, this
              is not necessary. You can use whatever action feels right in context and whichever icon you think is

            <para>The contents of this parameter are prefixed with the string literal <code>icon-</code> to create the
            HTML <code>class</code> attribute. For example,

            <note>
              <para>It is generally bad form using images for menu items.</para>

              <para>Images, especially raster (bitmap) images, may not display very well and make the backend of the
              site look cheap and unprofessional.</para>

              <para>Images, unlike language strings, are untranslatable and cannot be replaced for different languages
              and cultures. Iconography with vector images may have radically different meanings depending on the
              cultural context and personal circumstances. For example, an open palm facing the user with fingers spread
              out means "stop" in the USA but is a vulgar gesture in Greece and Cyprus (it literally means “I spread
              feces on your face”). A beer mug is a relatively inoffensive icon unless you're putting that in front of
              Muslims who are required to abstain from alcohol per their religion or recovering alcoholics (or those
              who've lost a loved one to a DUI fatal accident) who may find that iconography triggering.</para>

              <para>You <emphasis role="bold">MUST NOT</emphasis> use an icon instead of human-readable text content for
              the title of the menu item. This is inaccessible to people with disabilities such as hard-of-seeing or

      <title>Backend menu items</title>

      <para>Joomla 3.7 and later allow site integrators to create custom backend menus. This lets them fully customise
      the backend experience of Joomla for their clients, e.g. using terms which are more in-line with the purpose the
      menu items will be used instead of the more functional and technical terms the Joomla core and us third party
      developers use.</para>

      <para>If you do not do anything else, Joomla will simply list all of your <link
      linkend="com-menus-component">component's default menu items</link>, as they are defined in your XML manifest.
      This is the simplest way to do things, but it's not very configurable. Menu items created like that just take the
      user to the relevant view of your component.</para>

      <para>The other option you have is to create menu item configuration XML files in your backend
      <filename>tmpl</filename> folder's sub-folders. This is a lot like managing <link
      linkend="com-menus-frontend">frontend menu items</link>, with a few extra features.</para>

      <bridgehead>View XML files location and name</bridgehead>

      <para>Your view XML files are placed in the sub-folders of your <filename>tmpl</filename> folder and they are
      named after the view template file. For example, if you have a component <code>com_example</code>, a view named
      <code>welcome</code> and a view template for that view named <code>default</code> the view XML file would be
      <filename>administrator/components/com_example/tmpl/welcome/default.xml</filename>.</para>

      <bridgehead>View XML file structure</bridgehead>

      <para>A view XML file has the following overall structure:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;metadata&gt;
  &lt;layout title="COM_EXAMPLE_WELCOME_VIEW_DEFAULT_TITLE"&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;COM_EXAMPLE_WELCOME_VIEW_DEFAULT_DESC&lt;/message&gt;
  &lt;/layout&gt;
  &lt;!-- Add fields to the request variables for the layout. --&gt;
  &lt;fields name="request"&gt;
    &lt;fieldset
      name="request"
    &gt;
      &lt;field
        name="something"
        type="text"
        label="COM_EXAMPLE_WELCOME_VIEW_OPTION_SOMETHING_LABEL"
        description="COM_EXAMPLE_WELCOME_VIEW_OPTION_SOMETHING_DESC"
        /&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
  &lt;/fields&gt;
  &lt;fields name="params"&gt;
    &lt;fieldset name="basic"&gt;
      &lt;field
        name="menu-quicktask"
        type="radio"
        label="MOD_MENU_FIELD_SHOWNEW"
        layout="joomla.form.field.radio.switcher"
        &gt;
          &lt;option value=""&gt;JHIDE&lt;/option&gt;
          &lt;option value="index.php?option=com_example&amp;amp;task=item.add"&gt;JSHOW&lt;/option&gt;
      &lt;/field&gt;

      &lt;field
        name="menu-quicktask-title"
        type="hidden"
        default="COM_EXAMPLE_MENUS_NEW_ITEM"
        /&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
  &lt;/fields&gt;
&lt;/metadata&gt;            </programlisting>

      <para>The root tag of the XML document is always <code>&lt;metadata&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;layout&gt;</code>
      section is mandatory. The <code>&lt;fields&gt;</code> sections are optional.</para>

      <bridgehead>The <code>&lt;layout&gt;</code> section</bridgehead>

      <para>This section tells Joomla how to display the available menu item type to the site integrator when they are
      creating a custom backend menu item.</para>

      <para>The <code>title</code> attribute contains a language string which appears as the title of the menu type
      selector and in the <guilabel>Menu Item Type</guilabel> option of the menu item's edit page. Keep it short and to
      the point. Do not include the component's name in it unless it's absolutely necessary for disambiguation. In this
      case, you may want to use something like “Clear Cache (Example)”, i.e. put the component's name in parentheses
      after the view title.</para>

      <note>
        <para>When writing messages keep in mind the constraints of the human working memory. Short, to the point
        messages work best. There's less for the human operator to keep in their working memory. Put the important part
        first (message front-loading). That's why it makes sense to put the component name in parentheses at the end of
        the title; it's not as important as <emphasis>what the menu item does</emphasis>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The content of the <code>&lt;layout&gt;</code> tag can either be empty or contain exactly one
      <code>&lt;message&gt;</code> tag with a text content which is also a language string key<footnote>
          <para>Core components put the language string key inside a <code>&lt;![CDATA[…]]&gt;</code> wrapper. This is
          not necessary since Joomla 1.6. Language string keys are meant to only consist of uppercase, unaccented Latin
          letters without diacritics and underscores. These characters are allowed as the text value of an XML node. The
          CDATA wrapper is a leftover from Joomla 1.5 when the language string key was an entire English phrase,
          possibly containing characters not allowed in an XML document without being converted to entities.</para>
        </footnote>. This is a slightly longer description of what the view does. It is displayed in the view type
      selector right under the title. If you need to provide a description keep it short and do not repeat what can
      already be obviously inferred by reading the view title.</para>

      <bridgehead>The request &lt;fields&gt; section</bridgehead>

      <para>The XML file can have one or more <code>&lt;fields&gt;</code> sections. The first section we see in the
      example above are the request fields, wrapped in a <code>&lt;fields name="request"&gt;</code> tag. These define
      configuration parameters which will be present in the menu item's URL as GET parameters (i.e. part of the URL
      itself). The name of the URL parameter is the <code>name</code> attribute of the field tag and its value will be
      the URL parameter's value as well.</para>

      <para>This section contains exactly one <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> tag with <code>name="request"</code>. The
      fields in this set will be displayed in the <guilabel>Details</guilabel> tab of the menu item edit page.</para>

      <para>Remember that if you do not define any fields or omit this section altogether the resulting link will be
      <uri>index.php?option=com_example&amp;view=something&amp;layout=default</uri> where <code>com_example</code> is
      the name of your component, <code>something</code> is the name of the view (the name of the subfolder the XML file
      is in) and <code>default</code> is the name of the XML file without the .xml extension.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>If you want to provide GET URL parameters the user cannot modify use field tags with
        <code>type="hidden"</code>.</para>
      </tip>

      <bridgehead>The parameters &lt;fields&gt; section</bridgehead>

      <para>The next optional section is wrapped in a <code>&lt;fields name="params"&gt;</code> tag and has one or more
      <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> tags, rendered as tabs in the menu item edit page. If you do not specify a title and
      name your field set <code>basic</code> it will render as a tab labelled <guilabel>Options</guilabel>.</para>

      <para>While the request fields modify the URL generated by the menu link, the parameter fields modify how Joomla
      will display the menu item itself in the backend menu. The are the same as the <code>&lt;params&gt;</code> tags in
      the component's menu and, in fact, have the same names — so we're not copying the documentation here again.</para>

    </section>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="com-data-to-frontend">
    <title>Passing data from the backend to the JavaScript on the page</title>

    <para>Back in the early Joomla 3 days we used to send data to the frontend JavaScript code using inline JavaScript
    fragments. For example:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">JFactory::getDocument()-&gt;addScriptDeclaration(&lt;&lt;&lt;JS
  var comExampleSomething = "{$foobar}";
JS
);</programlisting>

    <para>On the client side (JavaScript) you'd just use this JavaScript variable.</para>

    <para>This is bad for a number of reasons. To begin with, the inline script declaration must definitely be parsed
    before any other code — including JavaScript files — which make use of it. Back when all scripts were loaded in the
    document's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> that was a given. However, this code broke spectacularly when met with any
    plugin or third party solution (such as CloudFlare RocketLoader) which moved the scripts at the bottom of the HTML
    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> or lazy-loaded them. There was no guaranteed script execution anymore.</para>

    <para>The variable being passed (in our example, <code>$foobar</code>) would have to be properly escaped to make it
    valid JavaScript or the client-side could break or, worse, we'd introduce a security vulnerability!</para>

    <para>Moreover, this solution pollutes the JavaScript global scope and slows down the page as the browser has to
    stop parsing the DOM and rendering the page to evaluate the JavaScript.</para>

    <para>Ever since Joomla 3.5 you had the option to instead push script options through the document:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">\Joomla\CMS\Factory::getDocument()-&gt;addScriptOptions(
  'com_example',
  [
    'foo' =&gt; $foobar,
    'bar' =&gt; SOME_CONSTANT,
  ]
);</programlisting>

    <para>This embeds a JSON document into the HTML which does not need to be parsed by the browser as JavaScript.
    Instead, when the core JavaScript loads it will parse it and make it available to our client-side code:</para>

    <programlisting language="javascript">var comExampleOptions = Joomla.getOptions('com_example');
var distance = comExampleOptions.foo * comExampleOptions.bar;</programlisting>

    <para>But how can we be sure that our code loads after the core Joomla JavaScript? Well, this is trivial in Joomla 4
    and later by using the <link linkend="concepts-webassetmanager">WebAssetManager</link> and adding <code>core</code>
    as a dependency. We also need to set our script to have the option <code>"defer": true</code> in our
    <filename>joomla.asset.json</filename> file so it loads deferred, i.e. after the browser parses the DOM — just like
    the core JavaScript does. This way we can be sure that our file executes after <code>Joomla.getOptions</code> is
    available in JavaScript and we no longer need to add special code to execute our code after the page has finished
    loading; both conditions are guaranteed.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="com-lang">
    <title>Language files</title>

    <para>The Joomla language files have not really changed much since Joomla 1.0. Joomla is using the <link
    xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI format</link> with a few twists:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The keys must always be in UPPERCASE. You cannot have keys in lowercase or MixedCase.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The values to the right of the equals sign must be enclosed in double quotes (<code>"</code>).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If you want to use double quotes inside your values you need to escape them as <code>\"</code>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Some language strings are used in JavaScript code using a legacy method. They do not support escaped
        double quotes. Use single quotes (<code>'</code>) instead, even for HTML attributes (yes, HTML allows you to do
        things like <code>&lt;a href='https://www.example.com'&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;</code> even though attribute values
        <emphasis>should</emphasis> use double quotes for compatibility with XHTML). If you want to put quotes around
        human-readable text you can also use calligraphic quotes: <code>“ ” ‘ ’</code> and so on.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You can comment a line by putting a semicolon (<code>;</code>) as its first character. Do not put
        semicolons at the end of strings, they might be parsed as part of the value.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <bridgehead>No more language tags in filenames</bridgehead>

    <para>There is a pretty big change for language file <emphasis>naming</emphasis> in Joomla 4 and beyond: <emphasis
    role="bold">you must not use the language prefix</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>In Joomla 1.5 to 3.10 inclusive language files were named like <filename>en-GB.com_example.ini</filename>
    (British English), <filename>de-DE.com_example.ini</filename> (German, Germany) and
    <filename>de-AT.com_example.ini</filename> (German, Austria).</para>

    <para>However, that naming was highly redundant as starting with Joomla 1.6 in 2010 the language files had to be
    placed in a folder whose name was the language tag itself! Inside a language folder you'd have the relative
    filepaths <filename>en-GB/en-GB.com_example.ini</filename>, <filename>de-DE/de-DE.com_example.ini</filename> and
    <filename>de-AT/de-AT.com_example.ini</filename>. Having the same language tag appear twice in a pathname didn't
    make sense. Therefore in Joomla 4 and beyond we no longer use the language tag prefix!</para>

    <para>The files are now simply named similar to <filename>com_example.ini</filename>. The language of the file is
    inferred from the folder name it's in. For example, the filepath <filename>en-GB/com_example.ini</filename>
    obviously refers to British English.</para>

    <bridgehead>Component language files</bridgehead>

    <para>A component has multiple different language files. The base name of all files is the name of the Joomla
    component extension, e.g. <code>com_example</code>:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Backend <filename>com_example.sys.ini</filename> — System language file. Required. Used to render the
        backend menu items and menu item types (for both front- and backend menu items).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Backend <filename>com_example.ini</filename> — Backend language file. Required. Used to render the backend
        interface and the component's Options page.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Frontend <filename>com_example.ini</filename> — Frontend language file. Optional (only if your component
        has a frontend part).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>API <filename>com_example.ini</filename> — API application language file. Optional (only if your component
        has an API application integration).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The language files are placed in the respective application's <filename>language</filename> subdirectory. For
    example, the backend language files for British English are placed in
    <filename>administrator/language/en-GB</filename>. Moreover, Joomla will fall back to the language subdirectory
    under your component. For example, the backend language files for British English are also sought for in
    <filename>administrator/components/com_example/language/en-GB</filename>. If files exist in both locations then
    <emphasis>only</emphasis> the one in the application's directory will be loaded.</para>

    <bridgehead>Language file autoloading</bridgehead>

    <para>Unlike previous versions of Joomla, you do NOT have to load your language files manually. Joomla loads your
    component's language files automatically.</para>

    <para>Since Joomla 3.3 (based on my recollection, +/- 1 minor version…) Joomla will load language files in this
    order:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>(Only if Debug Language is disabled). The language file for the site's default language
        (<code>en-GB</code>, unless a third party extension has changed it).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The currently active language's normative INI file (e.g. <code>com_example.ini</code>) or legacy INI file
        (e.g. <code>en-GB.com_example.ini</code>).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Joomla will first look in the current application's language folder i.e.
    <filename>administrator/language</filename> for the backend, <filename>language</filename> for the frontend and
    <filename>api/language</filename> for the API application.</para>

    <para>If neither the current language's, nor the default language's files have been found Joomla will fall back to
    your component's <filename>language</filename> directory. That is to say, your component's language directory is a
    last resort and not guaranteed to be used!</para>

    <para>You may wonder: why does Joomla load both the default language (British English in most cases)
    <emphasis>and</emphasis> my current language (e.g. Canadian French) files? The reason is simple. All components are
    required to provide a complete language file for the default language which for Joomla is British English<footnote>
        <para>Joomla started as a fork of another CMS called Mambo back in 2005. Mambo was originally developed by an
        Australian company. Australian and British English use the same spelling and are mostly the same, so that
        company chose to make British English the default language for Mambo. When Joomla forked off Mambo it retained
        the default language despite the fact that the majority of its co-founders were not even native English
        speakers.</para>

        <para>For the longest time Joomla's default language files were a mix of British, American and mangled English
        (most contributors are NOT native English speakers) but as of Joomla 3.9 a lot of effort has been put in British
        English being actually <emphasis>British</emphasis> English. There are separate language packages for US
        American English (for those who prefer ‘colored trash cans’ to ‘coloured rubbish bins’, for example) and other
        English spellings / dialects.</para>
      </footnote> (<code>en-GB</code>). Translation to other languages are optional and often incomplete. Sometime
    around 2012 we decided that it makes far more sense to show an English, human-readable string to non-English
    speakers they can look up in the dictionary or their favorite translation tool than an incomprehensible language key
    like <code>COM_EXAMPLE_ITEMS_SELECT_CATEGORY_DEFAULT_LABEL</code>. Of course this makes it harder for translators.
    That's why the Debug Language feature was simultaneously introduced. When enabled, the default language is not
    enabled and untranslated strings are marked clearly in the output.</para>

    <bridgehead>Defining language files in your XML manifest</bridgehead>

    <para>Your XML manifest needs one set of <tag>&lt;languages&gt;</tag> tags per target application.</para>

    <para>For the backend language files, you need to list them under the <tag>&lt;administration&gt;</tag> tag:</para>

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;administration&gt;
  &lt;!-- … --&gt;
  &lt;languages folder="languages/admin"&gt;
    &lt;language tag="en-GB"&gt;en-GB/com_example.ini&lt;/language&gt;
    &lt;language tag="en-GB"&gt;en-GB/com_example.sys.ini&lt;/language&gt;
    &lt;language tag="de-DE"&gt;de-DE/com_example.ini&lt;/language&gt;
    &lt;language tag="de-DE"&gt;de-DE/com_example.sys.ini&lt;/language&gt;
  &lt;/languages&gt;
  &lt;!-- … --&gt;
&lt;/administration&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>This copies the files from the <filename>languages/admin</filename> folder in your package to Joomla's admin
    language folder, e.g. the <filename>languages/admin/en-GB/com_example.ini</filename> file in your package to
    <filename>administrator/language/en-GB/com_example.ini</filename> file on your site.</para>

    <para>For the frontend language files, if you have any, you need to list them directly under the
    <tag>&lt;extension&gt;</tag> tag:</para>

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;extension&gt;
  &lt;!-- … --&gt;
  &lt;languages folder="languages/site"&gt;
    &lt;language tag="en-GB"&gt;en-GB/com_example.ini&lt;/language&gt;
    &lt;language tag="de-DE"&gt;de-DE/com_example.ini&lt;/language&gt;
  &lt;/languages&gt;
  &lt;!-- … --&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>This copies the files from the <filename>languages/site</filename> folder in your package to Joomla's site
    language folder, e.g. the <filename>languages/site/en-GB/com_example.ini</filename> file in your package to
    <filename>language/en-GB/com_example.ini</filename> file on your site.</para>

    <para>For the API application language files, if you have any, you need to list them under the
    <tag>&lt;api&gt;</tag> tag:</para>

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;api&gt;
  &lt;!-- … --&gt;
  &lt;languages folder="languages/api"&gt;
    &lt;language tag="en-GB"&gt;en-GB/com_example.ini&lt;/language&gt;
    &lt;language tag="de-DE"&gt;de-DE/com_example.ini&lt;/language&gt;
  &lt;/languages&gt;
  &lt;!-- … --&gt;
&lt;/api&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>This copies the files from the <filename>languages/api</filename> folder in your package to Joomla's api
    language folder, e.g. the <filename>languages/api/en-GB/com_example.ini</filename> file in your package to
    <filename>api/language/en-GB/com_example.ini</filename> file on your site.</para>

    <bridgehead>Languages and CLI</bridgehead>

    <para>CLI commands do <emphasis>not</emphasis> load any language files automatically. You can either supply your
    language strings in the <code>console</code> plugin which registers the commands or, more commonly, include them in
    your backend language file and have the plugin load that language file when registering the commands.</para>

    <bridgehead>Custom language files</bridgehead>

    <para>Beyond the regular <filename>.ini</filename> / <filename>.sys.ini</filename> files you can have any other
    language file you want. For example, you could have a <filename>com_example.alt.ini</filename> file which is only
    loaded when a specific option is enabled in your component. You can do that in your component's <link
    linkend="com-dispatcher">Dispatcher</link>. For example:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">$this-&gt;app-&gt;getLanguage()-&gt;load($this-&gt;option . '.alt', JPATH_BASE)
  || $this-&gt;app-&gt;getLanguage()-&gt;load($this-&gt;option . '.alt', JPATH_COMPONENT)</programlisting>

    <bridgehead>Language overrides</bridgehead>

    <para>Language overrides are loaded <emphasis>before</emphasis> any of your language files, at the initialisation of
    the CMSApplication object, namely when the Language object is constructed. They are stored in the file
    <filename>language/overrides/<replaceable>LANGUAGE_TAG</replaceable>.override.ini</filename> under the application's
    root (site root for the frontend, <filename>administrator</filename> for the backend, <filename>api</filename> for
    the API application) where <replaceable>LANGUAGE_TAG</replaceable> is the current language's tag, e.g.
    <code>en-GB</code> for British English.</para>

    <para>The way it works is that your language file is loaded and then the <emphasis>overridden</emphasis> strings are
    replaced into the language file <emphasis>if and only if</emphasis> they are already defined in the language
    file.</para>

    <caution>
      <para>This means that the language overrides cannot be used for language keys not defined in your language files,
      unlike Joomla 3.</para>

      <para>Since this was a widely popular “trick” to allow your users to customise the display of your components you
      now have to take that explicitly into account. For example, given an item with an alias <code>foobar</code> you
      might be looking for the language string <code>COM_EXAMPLE_ITEM_OVERRIDE_FOOBAR_TITLE</code> to override the title
      field of your item for display in different languages. This worked in Joomla 3 but will NOT work in Joomla 4 or
      later.</para>

      <para>You will need to provide an alternative mechanism for your users to provide custom translations. Remember
      the custom files I described just above? That's the alternative mechanism you can provide. DO NOT ship that file
      with your component. Just tell users to create it under their language folder and put their custom translations in
      there. It's far less user friendly than language overrides, unless of course you provide your own user interface
      for managing the contents of this file.</para>
    </caution>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="com-mailtemplates">
    <title>Mail Templates</title>

    <para>Joomla 4 introduced a new core component, Mail Templates (<code>com_mails</code>). You can access it from the
    System dashboard.</para>

    <para>This component allows you to manage email templates used by the different components which make use of
    Joomla's new Mail Templates feature. The user can choose to customise the plain text email's contents or even
    provide a full HTML email — or both. This is a much better user experience than language overrides, especially when
    it comes to HTML email.</para>

    <para>Using this feature is recommended, but not required. If you decide to use it for your components there's a bit
    of trouble you need to get through.</para>

    <bridgehead>Installing mail templates</bridgehead>

    <para>Mail templates live in the database, in the <database>#__mail_templates</database> table. The fields for each

        <listitem>
          <para>A JSON-serialised object with the parameters to the mail template. What is most important for us is its
          <code>tags</code> property. For example, you may have this <database>params</database> content:</para>

          <programlisting language="json">{
  "tags": [
    "FOO", "BAR", "BAZ"
  ]
}</programlisting>

          <para>This tells Mail Templates that you can use the variables <code>{FOO}</code>, <code>{BAR}</code> and
          <code>{BAZ}</code> in the subject, body and HTML body of the mail templates — and let users know that in the
          user interface. When sending emails via the Mail Templates feature you will have to provide the values for
          these variables. The variable names MUST always consist of uppercase letters, dashes, underscores and
          colons.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>Moreover, you will need to supply a few language strings in you backend INI language file (e.g.
    <filename>administrator/languages/en-GB/com_example.ini</filename>).</para>

    <para>You need to provide a language string whose key is the uppercase version of your extension name, e.g.</para>

    <programlisting language="ini">COM_EXAMPLE="Example component"</programlisting>

    <para>This is used in the Mail Templates drop-down for selecting a component to filter by.</para>

    <para>For each email template you will need to provide a few “magic” language strings <emphasis>on top of</emphasis>
    the language strings you defined in the <database>subject</database>, <database>body</database>, and
    <database>htmlbody</database> columns. Assuming a <database>template_id</database> <code>com_example.foo_bar</code>
    you will need to provide the following language strings:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><code><replaceable>COM_EXAMPLE</replaceable>_MAIL_<replaceable>FOO_BAR</replaceable>_TITLE</code></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>A long title for your email template, displayed in the user interface. The content of this language
          string should be something similar to “My Component Name: When This Mail Template Is Sent”.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><code><replaceable>COM_EXAMPLE</replaceable>_MAIL_<replaceable>FOO_BAR</replaceable>_SHORT</code></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>A short title for your email template. I am not sure when this is used.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><code><replaceable>COM_EXAMPLE</replaceable>_MAIL_<replaceable>FOO_BAR</replaceable>_DESC</code></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>A short description of your email template, displayed in the user interface.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <bridgehead>Using mail templates</bridgehead>

    <para>The Mail Templates feature does NOT send emails. It only provides you with a pre-configured Joomla Mailer
    object you will use to send emails with.</para>

    <para>This is how you use it:</para>

    <programlisting language="php">/**
 * @var string $templateId The template ID you want to use, e.g. com_example.foo_bar
 * @var string $langTag The language tag for your email, e.g. 'en-GB'
 */
$template = new \Joomla\CMS\Mail\MailTemplate($templateId, $langTag);

// Add the contents of your variables here
$template-&gt;addTemplateData([
  'FOO' =&gt; 'Contents of the {FOO} variable',
  'BAR' =&gt; 'Contents of the {BAR} variable',
  'BAZ' =&gt; 'Contents of the {BAZ} variable',
]);

/**
 * @var string $emailAddress The email address of the recipient, e.g. jane@example.com
 * @var string $recipientName The full name of your recipient, e.g. "Jane Doe"
 */
$template-&gt;addRecipient($emailAddress, $recipientName);

// Send the email
$template-&gt;Send();</programlisting>

    <para>If you want to customise the Joomla Mailer object used by the <classname>MailTemplate</classname> class —for
    example to set custom headers, add inline images or attachments which cannot be handled by MailTemplate, etc— you
    can pass it as the third parameter to its constructor, e.g.</para>

    <programlisting language="php">$mailer = \Joomla\CMS\Factory::getMailer();
$mailer-&gt;addCustomHeader('X-Vanity-Header', 'Joomla! Rocks');

$template = new \Joomla\CMS\Mail\MailTemplate($templateId, $langTag, $mailer);</programlisting>

    <para>Do keep in mind that each email template may have its own configuration about the sender address and sending
    method (e.g. SMTP information). These settings will override the same settings in your custom mailer object when you
    call <methodname>Send()</methodname>.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>The above will error out if MailTemplate cannot find a suitable template. You can check if a suitable
      template exists by doing this before any of the code above:</para>

      <programlisting language="php">$template = Joomla\CMS\Mail\MailTemplate::getTemplate($templateId, $langTag);</programlisting>

      <para>If $template is empty do NOT go through MailTemplate. You can simply not send the email, provide an
      alternative, throw an error or otherwise handle this condition in a way appropriate for your application.</para>
    </tip>

    <bridgehead>Caveats</bridgehead>

    <para>Users can, and <emphasis>will</emphasis>, mess up the Mail Templates. If they just mess up the subject, plain
    text body or HTML body they can recover easily by using the respective reset button in the user interface.</para>

    <para>If they create a specific language version of a mail template they cannot remove it without messing with the
    database.</para>

    <para>If you update a mail template, adding more tags (variables) in its parameters you will need to write update
    SQL which updates all entries with the relevant template_id <emphasis role="bold">BUT</emphasis> you should note
    that by overwriting the contents of the <database>params</database> column you will be resetting the user's
    preferences about the mailer itself (sender, sending method, credentials etc). Therefore updating mail templates
    <emphasis>actually</emphasis> requires writing PHP code in your extension's installation script to run on update,
    read all mail templates with the affected <database>template_id</database>, decode the <database>params</database>,
    update the tags and write everything back to the database. It's a big old pain in the posterior.</para>

    <para>A final word of caution. The MailTemplate class has some static methods such as
    <methodname>createTemplate</methodname> and <methodname>updateTemplate</methodname>. <emphasis role="bold">Don't use
    them</emphasis>. They will error out.</para>

  <section xml:id="com-cli">
    <title>The CLI application</title>

    <para>In Joomla 3 we could create CLI scripts for Joomla by extending the <classname>JApplicationCli</classname>
    class (later renamed to <classname>Joomla\CMS\Application\CliApplication</classname>) in a new file which we'd place
    in Joomla's <filename>cli</filename> directory. While that was a useful way to get access to all Joomla resources
    and API from our CLI it created a problem: there were too many files in the <filename>cli</filename> directory and
    it was not always clear which component they belong to. It also put a burden on third party developers like us to
    provide a <code>files</code> package with these CLI scripts and make sure that it gets updated together with our
    main extension package. There was also a lot of boilerplate code that had to go into each file, potentially
    different for each Joomla version we supported.</para>

    <para>In Joomla 4 we can still do that (but it's deprecated) or we can use the new <emphasis role="bold">Joomla CLI
    Application</emphasis>. This lives in <filename>cli/joomla.php</filename>. It is an extensible application using a
    CMSApplication class which uses the Symfony Console — much like Composer, WP-CLI and Drush. Unlike the
    aforementioned applications, it is not standalone. It is part of your site, making it the fourth official Joomla
    application bundled with the Joomla CMS (the other three being the frontend a.k.a. site application, the backend
    a.k.a. administrator application and the API application).</para>

    <section xml:id="com-cli-commands">
      <title>Command classes</title>

      <para>Like all Symfony Console applications, the Joomla CLI Application is extended with Command classes. The
      Joomla command classes need to extend from the <classname>\Joomla\Console\Command\AbstractCommand</classname>
      class.</para>

      <para><bridgehead>Where do command classes live?</bridgehead></para>

      <para>There are no hard rules about where you should put your command classes. There are two possibilities which
      make the most sense, as far as I can see.</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Inside the <code>console</code> plugin which registers the commands to the Joomla CLI
          Application.</para>

          <para>It makes sense because the plugin contains the code to the commands and registers them to the CLI
          application. However, it is possible that someone may disable or uninstall your component but not the console
          plugin. This would mean that the commands, or even their registration, will fail due to the component no
          longer being bootable. You will need to add special code to address that. Furthermore, there's the small but
          real risk that the user ends up with a console plugin that's older or newer than the installed component
          version, potentially causing havoc when the CLI commands are used.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Inside the backend part of your component.</para>

          <para>This is the way I prefer to do things and what I will show you. The commands are in the
          <code>CliCommand</code> leaf namespace of my component. For example, with a component that has the namespace
          prefix <code>Acme\Component\Example</code> I would put my commands in the
          <code>Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\CliCommand</code> namespace i.e. the folder
          <code>administrator/components/com_example/src/CliCommand</code>.</para>

          <para>The plugin does not need to check if the component is bootable; if it's not, the PSR-4 autoloader for
          its namespace won't be loaded and the command classes cannot be found. Therefore I just need to check if the
          command classes exist. Mixing the versions of the plugin and the component is not a problem either; the plugin
          will load the command classes it knows of and if some of them do not exist (the plugin is from a newer
          version) we simply skip it over.</para>

      <para><bridgehead>The command name (<code>$defaultName</code>)</bridgehead></para>

      <para>A command class needs to provide a name for the command being executed. In Joomla 4 ,third party extensions
      should use the convention <option>component:command</option> and <option>component:command:subcommand</option>
      where <replaceable>component</replaceable> is the name of the component without <command>com_</command>. The
      command part is the name of your command. If you need to implement subcommands you can add a third, fourth etc
      part in your command name, all separated with colons. For example we could have the following names:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><command>example:email</command> Process an email queue</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><command>example:items:list</command> Produce a list of items</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><command>example:items:delete</command> Delete an item</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The name of the command goes into the command class' <code>$defaultName</code> static property.</para>

      <para><bridgehead>Command configuration</bridgehead></para>

      <para>Each command needs a bit of configuration so that Joomla knows how to display it in a list of commands
      (<code>php joomla.php list</code>), provide help for a command (e.g. <code>php joomla.php example:items:list
      --help</code>) and parse the arguments and options to the command. This is done in the
      <methodname>configure()</methodname> method.</para>

      <para>Calling setDescription sets the short help text which appears next to the command in the list of available
      commands.</para>

      <para>Calling setHelp sets the longer help text which appears in the per-command help page.</para>

      <para>The rest of the method body defines the arguments and options to the commands, whether they are required or
      optional, their default values and their associated help text. This is explained in detail in the Symfony Console
      documentation article “<link xlink:href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/console/input.html">Console Input
      (Arguments &amp; Options)</link>”.</para>

      <para><bridgehead>Command implementation</bridgehead></para>

      <para>The implementation of your command, the code which executes when you call it, is in the
      <methodname>doExecute</methodname> method.</para>

      <para>The first thing we do is get a SymfonyStyle object to facilitate the formatting our command's output. It has
      all sorts of useful things, from titles and success / warning / error blocks to progress bars and tables. You can
      read more about it in the Symfony Console documentation article <link
      xlink:href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/console/style.html">How to Style a Console Command</link>.</para>

      <para>The rest of the code is pretty straightforward; it's standard Joomla stuff. What you need to note is that we
      always return an integer. This MUST be an integer from 0 to 255 (inclusive). It is used as the command line
      application's <link xlink:href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-shell-command-exit-codes">exit code</link>.
      It is very strongly recommended that you use a different exit code for each result state of your command
      <emphasis>and document it</emphasis>. This can be used in automation scenarios, e.g. someone using your CLI
      commands in an Ansible playbook or a custom shell script.</para>

      <note>
        <para>You may see that I've used the MVCFactoryAwareTrait and DatabaseAwareTrait traits. We will be using these
        traits to pass our component's MVCFactory and the Joomla database object when creating objects out of our
        command classes, before registering them to the Joomla CLI application, in our <code>console</code>
        plugin.</para>

        <para>While we could skip that and just fetch these <emphasis>dependencies</emphasis> directly in our console
        class, please do keep in mind that Joomla is trying to get us to use <emphasis>dependency injection</emphasis>,
        i.e. the object should be pushed the dependencies into it rather than having it to pull them from somewhere
        else. If there's a big architectural change in Joomla it's far easier to change things at the singular injection
        point rather than hunting down all places where we might be pulling dependencies. That's one of the many reasons
        Dependency Injection is used: it makes refactoring easier.</para>

      <para>As you can see, after creating the command object we push the MVCFactory into it — if it supports that

      <para>We could do the same for the database object. We'll let you figure it out. For the solution, you can read
      the footnote<footnote>
          <para>At the top of the plugin object define the <code>$db</code> property to let Joomla push the database
          object into the plugin object.</para>

          <programlisting language="php">protected $db;</programlisting>

          <para>In the registerCLICommand method, right after pushing the MVCFactory, push the database object:</para>

          <programlisting language="php">if (method_exists($command, 'setDbo'))
{
  $command-&gt;setDbo($this-&gt;db);

        </footnote>.</para>

      <para>Remember to not just install this plugin, but also publish it. You can publish the plugin automatically in
      the <code>install</code> section of your package's installation script. Remember, that code only runs on a new
      installation. If you want to enable this plugin also on updates you will need to do the same in the
      <code>update</code> section as well. Yes, it's a bit of a kludge but in practice it works very well.</para>

    <title>The API application</title>

    <para>Joomla version 1, 2 and 3 had no good, universal way of adding a <link
    xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</link> <link
    xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</link> API to a component. There was a hodgepodge of solutions
    (ab)using Joomla's routing to essentially end up with a format=json request query parameter post-SEO parsing and
    some basic logic to convert HTTP verbs into respective Controller tasks, sometimes with rudimentary support for
    <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Application_Language">HAL</link> or similar <link
    xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</link> solutions. In plain English: we had no good way to
    write JSON APIs which didn't suck royally!</para>

    <para>Joomla 4 addresses this problem with the introduction of a new official Joomla application, the API
    application which lives in the <filename>api</filename> folder of your site.</para>

    <section xml:id="com-api-overview">
      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>The API application uses a set of plugins in the <literal>webservices</literal> group to determine which of
      the installed API components will be responding to requests. These plugins are also responsible for determining
      the routes (URLs) for the respective component's JSON API. While having a plugin control whether a particular
      component provides an API may sound odd, it makes sense. Depending on the site, you don't always want to expose
      everything under the sun in a JSON API. For example, if you do not have a use case for listing the extensions over
      the JSON API it makes more security sense having that feature unpublished.</para>

      <para>Beyond the plugin, your component needs an API part just like it does for the frontend (site) and the
      backend (administrator) applications. The difference is that you only have Controllers, Models and Views. You do
      not have view templates. The Views descend from
      <classname>\Joomla\Component\Banners\Api\View\Banners\JsonapiView</classname> which manages the data conveyed
      through a <classname>\Joomla\CMS\Document\JsonDocument</classname> as a JSON formatted response.</para>

      <para>As for who can access the API… we'll see about that in the next section.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-api-access">
      <title>Access and Authentication</title>

      <para>In theory, the Joomla API application is only available to Super Users in Joomla 4. The idea is that this is
      a new and very powerful (a bit <emphasis>too </emphasis>powerful, maybe?) way to access the site, therefore the
      Joomla project felt that it should only be available to Super Users.</para>

      <para>Authentication for Super Users does not normally take place with a username and password but with a
      token<footnote>
          <para>The token is much safer than using a username and password. Joomla stores some of the information
          required to construct the token in the database (the <database>#__user_profiles</database> table) and some of
          it in the filesystem (the <varname>$secret</varname> in <filename>configuration.php</filename>). These two
          pieces of information are cryptographically combined to create the token, therefore SQL injections cannot be
          used to steal it. If it's compromised it can be quickly disabled or reset. A better solution would be a true
          OAuth2 flow but nobody has written the code for it (yet?).</para>
        </footnote>. You can find your token by editing your (Super User) profile in the back- or frontend of the site,
      as long as the <guilabel>User - Joomla API Token</guilabel> plugin is published. Authenticating with the token
      requires the API <guilabel>Authentication - Web Services Joomla Token</guilabel> plugin to be published as well.
      You pass the token in a standard Authentication HTTP header following <link
      xlink:href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#page-5">RFC 6750</link> for bearer tokens:</para>

      <programlisting>Authorization: Bearer c2hhMjU2OjcwOjg5NWQ5MDM3MjA1NTY2MzM2OWFmYjc0YTg1MGFmYWFjNTAyMGYyZTU2MjQ3OTkxZjMwNDE1MTNkNDQ2NjhjN2Y=</programlisting>

      <para>Alternatively, the token can be sent in the custom HTTP header with the name X-Joomla-Token:</para>

      <programlisting>X-Joomla-Token: c2hhMjU2OjcwOjg5NWQ5MDM3MjA1NTY2MzM2OWFmYjc0YTg1MGFmYWFjNTAyMGYyZTU2MjQ3OTkxZjMwNDE1MTNkNDQ2NjhjN2Y=</programlisting>

      <para>Practically speaking, use the latter header as the Authorization header may not be passed correctly by the
      server.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>When making requests to the Joomla API remember to send the HTTP header <literal>Accept</literal> with the
        content <literal>application/vnd.api+json</literal> (not just <literal>application/json</literal>). Otherwise
        you will get an HTTP 406 response.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>However, that is not the entire truth — nothing is ever that simple when you're talking
      authentication.</para>

      <para>It is perfectly possible to use Joomla's API application for a publicly accessible JSON API which does not
      perform any kind of authentication! This is, in fact, what Joomla's Media Manager (<code>com_media</code>) does.
      Counter-intuitively, the implementation for public routes is set up in the <emphasis
      role="bold">plugin</emphasis>, not the API component part. We'll see how in the <link linkend="com-api-plugin">web
      services plugin</link> section.</para>

      <para>This also means that you can do custom authentication using your own authentication mechanism by setting the
      routes to be public and performing authentication and access control in your API controllers. This is not entirely
      safe and I don't recommend it but, you know, the option does exist if you really need it and you really know what
      you are doing.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-api-component">
      <title>The API part of your component</title>

      <para>Starting with Joomla 4, your component has another optional<footnote>
          <para>A component <emphasis>must</emphasis> have a backend (administrator) part. The frontend (site) and api
          parts are optional. And, yes, this means that you can absolutely have a backend-only component but not a
          frontend-only or api-only component. The necessity for a backend part comes from the fact that the XML
          manifest, the configuration (config.xml) and the permissions (access.xml) files are present only in the
          backend directory of the component. The former is necessary for a component to be able to be installed,
          updated and uninstalled. Moreover, Joomla always creates a backend menu item for the component, meaning that
          the component must have a backend part with a default view even if it's just to display a message that there
          is nothing to do with this component in the backend.</para>
        </footnote> part: the <literal>api</literal> part. Just like the component's frontend (site) and backend
      (administrator) it has its own Controllers, Views, and Models to render not HTML pages but JSON result
      sets.</para>

      <para>The namespace suffix for the API application is <classname>Api</classname>. This means that a component with
      the namespace prefix <classname>Acme\Component\Example</classname> defined in its XML manifest will have the
      namespace prefix <classname>Acme\Component\Example\Api</classname> for all of its API application classes.</para>

      <section xml:id="com-api-component-manifest">
        <title>Adding it to your XML manifest</title>

        <para>If you are implementing an integration with the Joomla API application your XML manifest needs to have an
        <tag>&lt;api&gt;</tag> section under the <tag>&lt;extension&gt;</tag> root node, defining the files and folders
        included in your component's api part. Typically, it looks like this:</para>

        <programlisting language="xml">&lt;api&gt;
  &lt;files folder="api"&gt;
  &lt;folder&gt;src&lt;/folder&gt;
&lt;/files&gt;
&lt;/api&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Yes, typically you only have one folder, <filename>src</filename>, containing your Controllers, Views and
        Models.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="com-api-component-controllers">
        <title>Controllers</title>

        <para>The API controllers all extend from the core
        <classname>\Joomla\CMS\MVC\Controller\ApiController</classname> class. The API controllers will, by default,
        implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Do note that Read in this context means both returning a single
        item <emphasis>and</emphasis> returning a list of items.</para>

        <para>At a minimum, you need to override the <property>$contentType</property> and
        <property>$default_view</property> properties.</para>

        <para>The <property>$contentType</property> property is used as the context to the
        <literal>onGetApiAttributes</literal> and <literal>onGetApiRelation</literal> events. The former is used to
        modify the data of the JSON response. The latter is used to add related data to the JSON response.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Unfortunately, the content type is <emphasis>a very bad choice</emphasis> for context in these events
          because it's not unique across components and the component's name is not given in the event arguments. For
          example, the type <literal>groups</literal> is already duplicated in the core, for
          <literal>com_fields</literal> and <literal>com_users</literal>.</para>

          <para>For this reason, you may want to provide your extension's <property>$contentType</property> in the
          format <literal>com_example.item</literal>, i.e. prefix your content type with the name of your component and
          a dot. It's a far cry from being intuitive, especially since consumers will have to remove the prefix to find
          out the API route which gives them access to this content type, but at least it provides a valid, unique
          context for the events.</para>
        </note>

        <para>In most cases you do not want to change the <methodname>displayItem</methodname> (read one),
        <methodname>displayList</methodname> (read many), <methodname>delete</methodname> (remove),
        <methodname>add</methodname> (create), and <methodname>edit</methodname> (update) methods. When you do, it's
        mostly so you can set a filter state in the view's Model. Joomla's core components do that a lot in their api
        application part.</para>

        <para>You will most likely need to override one or more of the following methods for most real world
        components:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><methodname>allowEdit</methodname>. Is the current user allowed to edit (update) the item? By default,
            it only checks the <literal>core.edit</literal> privilege of the current user for your component. The method
            is passed the data and the table's primary key in case you need to do more fine grained access control. For
            example, a forum component will very reasonably only allow the user who posted a specific post and the forum
            administrators to edit a post, not any random person who can post into the forum.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><methodname>allowAdd</methodname>. Is the current user allowed to add (create) a new item? By default,
            it only checks if the currently logged in user has the <literal>core.create</literal> privilege for your
            component or they have the <literal>core.create</literal> privilege in any categories which belong to your
            component (assuming you are integrating with Joomla's com_categories). The method is passed the data to be
            created in case you need to perform more fine-grained access control. For example, a helpdesk component
            would only allow the user who owns a support ticket and the support staff to post replies to a specific
            ticket. The view handling replies would check the ticket ID in the data to determine if this is the case
            before allowing a new post to be created.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><methodname>preprocessSaveData</methodname>. This is executed after allowEdit and allowAdd, but before
            handling tags and saving the data into the database. This is your last chance to make any modifications to
            the data before committing it to the database. For example, you may want to perform additional validation
            and cleanup of HTML content, or you may want to automatically fill in missing information which would cause
            a validation error when the Model tries to save the data.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="com-api-component-models">
        <title>Models</title>

        <para>You do not <emphasis>need</emphasis> to have API-specific Models in your component. If you do not provide
        a Model, the API application will use the Administrator models instead. This is usually what you want to do.
        There are very few cases where the API application needs a different model to both the Administrator and the
        Site model.</para>

        <para>If you do need to create Models, follow the same conventions as you'd do for Models in the Administrator
        part of your application. The only difference is that the namespace prefix uses <classname>Api</classname>
        instead of <classname>Administrator</classname>.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="com-api-component-views">
        <title>Views</title>

        <para>View classes in the API application are the biggest change to what you are used to doing in Joomla
        components.</para>

        <para>All these years you have been writing components with a backend and frontend part. Most of the time you
        had a View class whose purpose was to generate HTML using view templates. Quite rarely some of you may have used
        a raw, XML or JSON view to output something else such as INI data, binary data (e.g. an image), and XML document
        or a JSON string. In all cases you were more or less constructing the data as a string and had your view return
        that string.</para>

        <para>The API application views extend from <classname>\Joomla\CMS\MVC\View\JsonApiView</classname> which is a
        special version of the good, old, reliable <classname>\Joomla\CMS\MVC\View\JsonView</classname> we had for
        years. Its biggest difference is that you are no longer constructing and return a <emphasis>string</emphasis>.
        Instead, you have a <classname>\Joomla\CMS\Serializer\JoomlaSerializer</classname> object which figures out how
        to best convert your raw data to a JSON representation. Moreover, you have separate methods for displaying a
        single item (<methodname>displayItem</methodname>) versus displaying a list of items
        (<methodname>displayList</methodname>).</para>

        <para>The two methods need to know which of the fields returned by your Model's <methodname>getItem</methodname>
        and <methodname>getItems</methodname> methods, respectively, needs to be output in the JSON document. You can do
        that by setting two string array properties, <property>$fieldsToRenderItem</property> and
        <property>$fieldsToRenderList</property>. The former lists all the fields to be output when rendering a single
        item view (the <methodname>displayItem</methodname> method in the Controller) and the latter lists all the
        fields to be output when rendering a view which returns multiple items (the
        <methodname>displayList</methodname>method in the Controller).</para>

        <note>
          <para>At first glance this sounds tedious, if not pointless, but it does make sense when you start thinking
          about it. When listing tree entries, like menu items, there is no point in outputting the internal fields
          <literal>lft</literal>, <literal>rgt</literal>, <literal>level</literal> and so on which are only used to
          manage the tree. Moreover, and assuming you implement your own access control, you may want to return
          different fields depending on the user's privileges. For example, a helpdesk component's user may get access
          to their ticket information but not the internal notes on it kept by the support staff;
          <emphasis>that</emphasis> would only be available to the support staff. Do not discount everything Joomla does
          as silly. More often than not there's method to its madness.</para>
        </note>

        <para>The hidden gem of the API view is another string array property, <property>$relationship</property>. In
        that view you list all the field names returned by your model which refer to <emphasis>related data</emphasis>.
        Now, this is where things get interesting! A contact has, for example, a user ID. The user ID tells us nothing.
        However, the user ID is not a standalone thing; it's a reference to the <emphasis>related</emphasis> user
        record. Therefore listing <literal>user_id</literal> in the <code>$relationship</code> array tells the
        <classname>JsonapiView</classname> that it needs to fetch that related record and include it in the returned
        JSON document along with information which tells the consumer that this embedded JSON document refers to that
        <literal>user_id</literal> — and the URL to use to get more information about it.</para>

        <para>There is a catch to using relations: you need a custom Serializer object which extends
        <classname>\Joomla\CMS\Serializer\JoomlaSerializer</classname> and adds one public method named after each
        relationship field. Each method returns a <classname>\Tobscure\JsonApi\Relationship</classname> object which is
        used to output the relationship links in the JSON document. The custom Serialiser object is assigned to the
        <property>serializer</property> property of your JsonapiView in its constructor. This sounds very abstract and
        confusing; it's best if you observe it in real world code. I recommend taking a look at Joomla's own
        <classname>\Joomla\Component\Content\Api\View\Articles\JsonapiView</classname> and
        <classname>\Joomla\Component\Content\Api\Serializer\ContentSerializer</classname> to get a feeling of how you
        can add relationships in JSON API views.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="com-api-plugin">
      <title>Web services plugin</title>

      <para>The second thing required for your component to integrate with the Joomla API application is a
      <literal>webservices</literal> plugin. This plugin serves a dual role.</para>

      <para>On one hand it lets the user determine which components will participate in the Joomla API application — if
      they do not have a use case for your component's JSON API they can and should disable the plugin.</para>

      <para>On the other hand the plugin implements routing for your API application. That's right; there is no such
      thing as a Router service for the API application since the URL structure is meant to be predefined and
      predictable<footnote>
          <para>As opposed to being defined by the site's owner and limited by that person's ability to create a
          sensible menu structure — something which, according to my experience working on thousand of sites' backends,
          is most definitely not a given. At some point I will probably have to write a series of blog posts or yet
          another book on how to realistically build Joomla sites…</para>
        </footnote>. As a matter of fact, the only event handler we implement in this plugin is
      <literal>onBeforeApiRoute</literal>.</para>

      <para>The <literal>onBeforeApiRoute</literal> event handler takes exactly one argument, an object instance of
      <classname>\Joomla\CMS\Router\ApiRouter</classname>. This is a subclass of Joomla's
      <classname>\Joomla\Router\Router</classname> class, optimised for use in the API application.</para>

      <para>There are two ways to add routes for your component's API application integration, both using the router
      object.</para>

      <para>The first way is calling the object's <methodname>createCRUDRoutes</methodname> method. This methods creates
      five routes (named after the respective HTTP verbs):</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A <literal>GET</literal> route which returns a list of records.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <literal>GET</literal> route with an <literal>id</literal> parameter which returns a single
          record.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <literal>POST</literal> route to add a new record.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <literal>PATCH</literal> route with an <literal>id</literal> parameter which updates (“edits”) an
          existing record.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <literal>DELETE</literal> route with an <literal>id</literal> parameter which deletes an existing
          record.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>As you may have intuited, these are the five CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations supported by
      Joomla's controllers and more specifically the ApiController. The HTTP verbs for each CRUD operation are those
      specified in the REST specification. So, yes, Joomla lets us <emphasis>easily</emphasis> create RESTful JSON APIs,
      as promised. Neat, huh?!</para>

      <para>This method takes four arguments:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><parameter>$baseName</parameter>. The base name of our route. The recommended format is similar to
          <uri>v1/example</uri> (for the default API route of your component) or <uri>v1/example/items</uri>.</para>

          <para>The <literal>v1</literal> part is used for versioning your API. Start with v1 for the first version of
          your component's API. If you make a backwards incompatible change bump it to v2, then v3 and so on.</para>

          <para>The next part <emphasis>should</emphasis> be your component's name without the <literal>com_</literal>
          prefix.</para>

          <para>Some components manage more than one content type. For example a helpdesk component will have at the
          very least a ticket and a reply content type, the former being a representation of all the metadata of the
          ticket (title, date, owner, …) and the latter being a representation of the actual posts sent by the
          participants. In these cases the secondary, tertiary etc content items get their own route by adding one more
          level in the base name of the route.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><parameter>$controller</parameter>. The <emphasis role="bold">name (string)</emphasis> of your
          component's controller which will be handling the request. This must be in all lowercase.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><parameter>$defaults</parameter>. This is an array of URL parameters which are added by default when
          parsing the route. At the very least it should be something like <code>['component' =&gt;
          '<replaceable>com_example</replaceable>']</code> where <replaceable>com_example</replaceable> is your
          component's name.</para>

          <para>If you are using Joomla's category management the API route to manage the categories for your component
          will be using the following defaults: <code>['component' =&gt; 'com_categories', 'extension' =&gt;
          '<replaceable>com_example</replaceable>']</code> where <replaceable>com_example</replaceable> is your
          component's name.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><parameter>$publicGets</parameter>. This is a boolean. By default it's false which means that only
          authenticated users will be allowed to list items using GET. If you set it to true then anyone who figures out
          the URL can use GET to get a list of items and read all items.</para>

          <warning>
            <para>If you set <varname>$publicGets</varname> to true you most likely have to override the
            <methodname>displayItem</methodname> and <methodname>displayList</methodname> methods in the respective
            controller to perform custom access control appropriate to your component. Most likely the items you want to
            show publicly are not <emphasis>all</emphasis> the items (including unpublished, deleted and possibly
            access-controlled) your component knows about.</para>
          </warning>

          <caution>
            <para>If you have a public route you MUST think about which fields you'll be including in your JsonapiView
            object. Not all fields are suitable for public display; that could lead to a security vulnerability known as
            information disclosure.</para>

            <para>For example, your forum component may be saving the IP address alongside the user ID and creation date
            and time of a forum post. DO NOT make the IP address and user ID available to the public. This combination
            is considered Personally Identifiable Information and can result in fines! Just the user ID may be
            privileged information depending on the context of the site (remember that usernames are not privileged
            information, but the internal user IDs are).</para>
          </caution>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The second way to add routes to the ApiRouter is, of course, using its <methodname>addRoute</methodname> or
      <methodname>addRoutes</methodname> methods, just like any standard Joomla router object. The former accepts a
      single <classname>\Joomla\Router\Route</classname> object whereas the latter accepts an array of Route
      objects.</para>

      <para>The constructor of the <classname>\Joomla\Router\Route</classname> object accepts five arguments:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><parameter>$methods</parameter>. This is an array of strings consisting of the HTTP verbs this route
          will be handling. The HTTP verbs must be in uppercase, e.g. <code>['GET']</code>, <code>['POST',
          'PUT']</code>, or <code>['PUT', 'PATCH']</code> to mention three of the most practical examples.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><parameter>$pattern</parameter>. This is the same as the <parameter>$baseName</parameter> of the
          <methodname>createCRUDRoutes</methodname> method with an added feature. If you want to include parameters,
          e.g. an ID, you will define it as <code>:something</code> (note the colon in the front). This may be very
          familiar to those of you who've written routes for Symfony or Laravel applications. For example, the pattern
          <uri>v1/example/items/:id</uri> tells Joomla that this route will <emphasis>only</emphasis> match if the
          <uri>v1/example/items</uri> route is followed by <emphasis>something</emphasis> which will be made available
          as the request parameter named <literal>id</literal>. If that <emphasis>something</emphasis> does not exist
          the route does not match and Joomla won't use it. What that something must look like for the route to match?
          See <parameter>$rules</parameter> below!</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><parameter>$controller</parameter>. This is <emphasis role="bold">different</emphasis> to the
          <parameter>$controller</parameter> of the <methodname>createCRUDRoutes</methodname> method in that it needs to
          have both the controller and the task, in all lowercase, separated by a dot. For example:
          <code>item.add</code>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><parameter>$rules</parameter>. If your route pattern has parameters you will provide a Regular
          Expression pattern the value must match for the route to match. For example <code>['id' =&gt; '(\d+)']</code>
          tells Joomla that the <literal>id</literal> parameter (which was defined as <literal>:id</literal> in the
          pattern) must be an integer consisting of one or more digits — including the value
          <literal>0</literal>.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>This comes in very handy if you want to have the exact same GET route accept either a numeric ID or a
            text slug — assuming your component enforces unique slugs. In this case you would define two routes like
            this:</para>

            <programlisting>$router-&gt;addRoutes([
  new Route(['GET'], 'v1/example/items/:id', 'item.displayItem',
    ['id' =&gt; '(\d+)'], ['option' =&gt; 'com_example']),
  new Route(['GET'], 'v1/example/items/:slug', 'item.displayItem',
    ['slug' =&gt; '(.*)'], ['option' =&gt; 'com_example']),
]);</programlisting>

            <para>If the parameter is numeric the first route matches and the parameter is made available as the
            <literal>id</literal> request parameter. Otherwise, the parameter matches the second route and the parameter
            is made available as the <literal>slug</literal> request parameter. Your overridden
            <code>ItemController::displayItem</code> method would first check if the <literal>id</literal> request
            parameter exists and non-empty. If not, it would look for a non-empty <literal>slug</literal> request
            parameter and find the correct ID of the record to display by making a database query.</para>
          </tip>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><parameter>$defaults</parameter>. This is the same as the <parameter>$defaults</parameter> of the
          <methodname>createCRUDRoutes</methodname> method with one addition. If you have a GET route and you want it to
          be accessible by unauthenticated users you need to add <code>['public' =&gt; true]</code> to the
          <parameter>$defaults</parameter> array. If you want it to only be accessible by authenticated users you need
          to add <code>['public' =&gt; false]</code>.</para>
        </listitem>

  <section xml:id="com-scheduled-tasks">
    <title>Integration with Scheduled Tasks</title>

    <para>Joomla 4.1 and later have an amazingly useful new feature called Scheduled Tasks. This is not really part of a
    component, it's just a plugin type, but since it is often used in conjunction with a component it makes sense to
    mention it here. You can read more about plugins in general in the <link linkend="plg">Plugins</link> chapter of
    this book.</para>

    <para>Scheduled Tasks allow the user to define repeated, unattended tasks which run on a schedule. It's like CRON
    jobs but without necessarily needing a CRON server on the site's server. They can be triggered with CRON jobs, with
    a special URL (e.g. using web-based pseudo-CRON services such as WebCRON.org), or automatically based on the site's
    traffic in what is called Lazy Scheduling.</para>

    <para>The best way to understand how a Scheduled Task plugin works is looking at the demo tasks plugin under
    <filename>plugins/task/demotasks</filename> folder on your site; it is part of Joomla itself.</para>

    <para>You create a plugin which provides one or more scheduled tasks in the <literal>task</literal> plugins folder.
    The plugin extension must implement <classname>\Joomla\Event\SubscriberInterface</classname>. It also needs to make
    use of the <classname>\Joomla\Component\Scheduler\Administrator\Traits\TaskPluginTrait</classname>. The trait
    provides all the magic.</para>

    <para>You need to handle three events:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><literal>onTaskOptionsList</literal>. This is set to be handled by the
        <methodname>advertiseRoutines</methodname> method implemented in the <classname>TaskPluginTrait</classname>.
        This tells Joomla to add task types based on the contents of the <constant>TASKS_MAP</constant> constant of your
        plugin.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>onExecuteTask</literal>. This is handled by the <methodname>standardRoutineHandler</methodname>
        method implemented in the <classname>TaskPluginTrait</classname>. When a scheduled task type the plugin can
        handle is being executed, this method will call your respective plugin method, as defined in the
        <constant>TASKS_MAP</constant> constant of your plugin.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>onContentPrepareForm</literal>. This is handled by the
        <methodname>enhanceTaskItemForm</methodname> method implemented in the <classname>TaskPluginTrait</classname>.
        It tells the Scheduled Tasks manager to use the XML forms which define each task type's options when the user
        creates a scheduled task with this task type.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The <constant>TASKS_MAP</constant> constant is the most important part of the plugin. It is an array with task
    definitions like this:</para>

    <programlisting>private const TASKS_MAP = [
  'exampleTask.foobar' =&gt; [
    'langConstPrefix' =&gt; 'PLG_TASK_EXAMPLE_TASK_FOOBAR',
    'method'          =&gt; 'foobar',
    'form'            =&gt; 'foobar',
  ],
];</programlisting>

    <para>Do note that in this example we define one task type. It is possible and most of the times desirable for a
    task plugin to define more than one task types. In this case the <constant>TASKS_MAP</constant> array will have more
    than one elements.</para>

    <para>The outermost key for each entry, in our example <literal>exampleTask.foobar</literal>, tells Joomla what is
    the internal name of the task type we are defining. The convention is to use
    <literal><replaceable>something</replaceable>Task.<replaceable>taskName</replaceable></literal> where
    <replaceable>something</replaceable> is the name of our plugin and <replaceable>taskName</replaceable> is a fairly
    short name for the task type. This will be stored in the database; you must not change it between different versions
    of your task plugin.</para>

    <para>In the innermost array we have three keys:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><literal>langConstPrefix</literal>. Required. The common prefix of the language strings used for this task
        type. The convention is to use the format
        <literal>PLG_TASK_<replaceable>SOMETHING</replaceable>_TASK_<replaceable>TASKNAME</replaceable></literal> where
        <replaceable>something</replaceable> is the name of our plugin and <replaceable>taskName</replaceable> is a
        fairly short name for the task type. The plugin's language INI file will have to define at least two language
        strings:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><literal>PLG_TASK_<replaceable>SOMETHING</replaceable>_TASK_<replaceable>TASKNAME</replaceable>_TITLE</literal>.
            The title of the task type, displayed to the user. Keep it very short and descriptive.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><literal>PLG_TASK_<replaceable>SOMETHING</replaceable>_TASK_<replaceable>TASKNAME</replaceable>_DESC</literal>.
            A longer description of the task type, displayed to the user. Try to keep it under 50 words.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>method</literal>. Required. The name of the plugin method which will be handling the task type.
        It's customary to name it after the <replaceable>taskName</replaceable> you used in the previous keys.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>form</literal>. Optional. The filename, without the .xml extension, of the XML form file which
        adds the configuration parameters to the task type when the user is editing the definition of a task. This file
        is placed in the <filename>forms</filename> folder of the plugin.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The method which handles each task type has the following signature:</para>

    <programlisting>public function foobar(
  \Joomla\Component\Scheduler\Administrator\Event\ExecuteTaskEvent $event
): int</programlisting>

    <para>The <parameter>$event</parameter> parameter is a standard Joomla event object. To get the task definition from
    the event you need to do</para>

    <programlisting>$task = $event-&gt;getArgument('subject');</programlisting>

    <para>This gives you a <classname>\Joomla\Component\Scheduler\Administrator\Task\Task</classname> object.</para>

    <para>To get the configuration parameters of the task, as a simple <classname>stdClass</classname> object, you can
    do:</para>

    <programlisting>$params = $event-&gt;getArgument('params');</programlisting>

    <para>Your method does NOT set a result value to the <parameter>$event</parameter> object; it's not an event handler
    per se. It instead returns an integer value which must be one of the constants defined in
    <classname>\Joomla\Component\Scheduler\Administrator\Task\Status</classname>. You should realistically only use the
    following constants as return values:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><constant>KNOCKOUT</constant>. An error occurred. The task execution will appear failed. The task will be
        rescheduled normally for its next execution according to its configured schedule.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><constant>OK</constant>. Success. The task execution will appear successful. The task will be rescheduled
        normally for its next execution according to its configured schedule.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><constant>WILL_RESUME</constant>. Temporary pause. The task has more work to do but halted execution to
        avoid a timeout. The task execution will appear to be ongoing. The task is rescheduled to resume execution as
        soon as possible i.e. the next time Joomla is asked to check whether any tasks need to execute. Please note that
        if your task is being resumed the following will return true:</para>

        <programlisting>$resuming = $event
  -&gt;getArgument('subject')
  -&gt;get('last_exit_code', Status::OK) === Status::WILL_RESUME;</programlisting>

        <para>Resumable tasks are great for long operations, like resizing hundreds of images or sending a newsletter to
        thousands of recipients, which might otherwise time out if you tried executing them in a single run. Split your
        work into small batches and/or check how much time has elapsed since you started doing some work. If a batch is
        complete and/or you have spent more than a configured maximum amount of time (typically useful values are 3, 5,
        10, 20 and 30 seconds) return a Status::WILL_RESUME. Next time your task runs checks if the last_exit_code
        parameter is Status::WILL_RESUME and continue your work where you left off.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Earlier, we talked about having an XML form file to add parameters to the Scheduled Task type. The contents of
    the file look like this:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;fields name="params"&gt;
    &lt;fieldset name="task_params"&gt;
      &lt;field
        name="my_parameter"
        type="text"
        label="PLG_TASK_EXAMPLE_TASK_FOOBAR_MY_PARAMETER_LABEL"
        description="PLG_TASK_EXAMPLE_TASK_FOOBAR_MY_PARAMETER_DESC"
        default=""
      /&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
  &lt;/fields&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;        </programlisting>

    <para>The <tag>form</tag> tag has a <tag>fields</tag> tag whose name is <literal>params</literal> and inside it
    there is a <tag>fieldset</tag> tag whose name is <literal>task_params</literal>. The fields inside the
    <tag>fieldset</tag> are rendered in the task definition page.</para>

    <para>There is a special case where you can have a <tag>fieldset</tag> tag outside the <tag>fields</tag> tag; if you
    want your task to only be available for execution when Scheduled Tasks are executed through a Joomla CLI application
    command. This can be very useful if you have a very long running operation you do not want to (or cannot reasonably)
    break into smaller sub-tasks to make it a resumable task. In this case, we will add another <tag>fieldset</tag> tag
    whose name is <literal>aside</literal> and place a special hidden field in it. See below, highlighted in bold
    type:</para>

    <para><programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
  <emphasis role="bold">&lt;fieldset name="aside"&gt;
    &lt;field name="cli_exclusive" type="hidden" default="1" /&gt;
  &lt;/fieldset&gt;</emphasis>
  &lt;fields name="params"&gt;
    &lt;fieldset name="task_params"&gt;
      &lt;field
        name="my_parameter"
        type="text"
        label="PLG_TASK_EXAMPLE_TASK_FOOBAR_MY_PARAMETER_LABEL"
        description="PLG_TASK_EXAMPLE_TASK_FOOBAR_MY_PARAMETER_DESC"
        default=""
      /&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
  &lt;/fields&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;        </programlisting>That's really all there is to it! Since this is a regular Joomla plugin and
    assuming your component is native Joomla 4 (therefore its classes can autoload from anywhere in Joomla) you can of
    course pass your component's <classname>MVCFactory</classname> instance to the plugin and use it to get access to
    your component's Models and Tables. Therefore, your tasks can reuse your component's code. Remember that you write
    good software by staying DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself — reuse your objects and traits instead of copying and pasting
    the same code all over the place).</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="com-fields">
    <title>Custom fields</title>

    <para>Implementing custom fields is relatively simple. For starters, your component extension must implement the
    <interfacename>Joomla\CMS\Fields\FieldsServiceInterface</interfacename>. The two methods defined in the interface
    are implemented a lot like this in most cases:</para>

    <programlisting>public function validateSection($section, $item = null)
{
  if (!in_array($section, ['categories', 'item'])) {
    return null;
  }

  return $section;
}

public function getContexts(): array
{
  Factory::getApplication()-&gt;getLanguage()-&gt;load('com_example', JPATH_ADMINISTRATOR);

  return [
    'com_example.item'       =&gt; Text::_('COM_EXAMPLE_TITLE_ITEMS'),
    'com_example.categories' =&gt; Text::_('JCATEGORY'),
  ];
}</programlisting>

    <para>The former method makes sure that a context's section (the stuff after the dot) is a valid section where you
    expect custom fields to exist. In this example we expect two sections, <literal>categories</literal> and
    <literal>item</literal>.</para>

    <para>The latter method returns a list of contexts for our component where custom fields can be defined. We defined
    the two contexts corresponding to the sections we accept in the <methodname>validateSection</methodname> method. The
    return values will be used by <literal>com_fields</literal> to render the drop-down which lets the user select the
    section for which they define custom fields for your component.</para>

    <para>Your XML manifest must, of course, include two links to the Joomla Fields component, one for the Fields and
    one for the Fields group. Use one of the contexts you returned in the <methodname>getContexts</methodname> method
    above. Do NOT use the context for categories.</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;menu link="option=com_fields&amp;amp;view=fields&amp;amp;context=com_example.item"&gt;
  JGLOBAL_FIELDS
  &lt;params&gt;
    &lt;menu-quicktask&gt;&lt;![CDATA[index.php?option=com_fields&amp;view=field&amp;layout=edit&amp;context=com_example.item]]&gt;&lt;/menu-quicktask&gt;
    &lt;menu-quicktask-title&gt;COM_EXAMPLE_SUBMENU_FIELDS_NEW&lt;/menu-quicktask-title&gt;
    &lt;menu-quicktask-permission&gt;core.create;com_fields&lt;/menu-quicktask-permission&gt;
  &lt;/params&gt;
&lt;/menu&gt;

&lt;menu link="option=com_fields&amp;amp;view=groups&amp;amp;context=com_example.item"&gt;
  JGLOBAL_FIELD_GROUPS
  &lt;params&gt;
    &lt;menu-quicktask&gt;&lt;![CDATA[index.php?option=com_fields&amp;view=group&amp;layout=edit&amp;context=com_example.item]]&gt;&lt;/menu-quicktask&gt;
    &lt;menu-quicktask-title&gt;COM_EXAMPLE_SUBMENU_FIELD_GROUPS_NEW&lt;/menu-quicktask-title&gt;
    &lt;menu-quicktask-permission&gt;core.create;com_fields&lt;/menu-quicktask-permission&gt;
  &lt;/params&gt;
&lt;/menu&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>Your backend item edit pages <emphasis>should</emphasis> display the custom fields automatically — as long as
    you render all of the form's fieldset without looking for specific names. For example, something similar to this
    code:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;?php
use Joomla\CMS\HTML\HTMLHelper;
use Joomla\CMS\Language\Text;
use Joomla\CMS\Router\Route;
?&gt;
&lt;form action="&lt;?= Route::_('index.php?option=com_example&amp;view=item&amp;layout=edit&amp;id=' . $this-&gt;item-&gt;id) ?&gt;"
  aria-label="&lt;?= Text::_('COM_ATS_TITLE_TICKETS_EDIT', true) ?&gt;"
  class="form-validate"
  id="adminForm"
  method="post"
  name="adminForm"
&gt;
  &lt;input name="task" type="hidden" value=""&gt;
  &lt;?= HTMLHelper::_('form.token') ?&gt;

  &lt;?php foreach ($this-&gt;form-&gt;getFieldsets() as $fieldSet): ?&gt;

  &lt;div class="card mb-2"&gt;
    &lt;h3 class="card-header bg-info text-white"&gt;
      &lt;?= Text::_($this-&gt;form-&gt;getFieldsets()[$fieldSet]-&gt;label) ?&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
      &lt;?php echo $this-&gt;form-&gt;renderFieldset($fieldSet); ?&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>Joomla handles loading and saving the values of custom fields automatically as long as the Content - Fields
    plugin is published.</para>

    <para>In the frontend, fields' contents are returned through the <literal>onContentAfterTitle</literal>,
    <literal>onContentAfterDisplay</literal> and <literal>onContentBeforeDisplay</literal> events. Typically, the
    implementation in your HtmlView class looks similar to this:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;?php
use Joomla\CMS\Factory;
use Joomla\CMS\MVC\View\HtmlView as BaseHtmlView;
use Joomla\CMS\Plugin\PluginHelper;

class HtmlView extends BaseHtmlView
{
  /**
   * The item object details
   *
   * @var    \Joomla\CMS\Object\CMSObject
   *
   * @since  1.6
   */
  protected $item;

  // ... your code here ...

  /**
   * Execute and display a template script.
   *
   * @param   string  $tpl  The name of the template file to parse; automatically searches through the template paths.
   *
   * @return  void|boolean
   */
  public function display($tpl = null)
  {
    $app        = Factory::getApplication();
    $state      = $this-&gt;get('State');
    $item       = $this-&gt;get('Item');
    $this-&gt;form = $this-&gt;get('Form');

    // ... your code here ...

    // Process the content plugins.
    PluginHelper::importPlugin('content');
    $offset = $state-&gt;get('list.offset');

    // Some plugins require a text attribute without checking if it exists
    $item-&gt;text = '';

    $app-&gt;triggerEvent('onContentPrepare', [
      'com_example.item', &amp;$item, &amp;$item-&gt;params, $offset
    ]);

    // Store the events for later
    $item-&gt;event = new \stdClass();

    $results = $app-&gt;triggerEvent('onContentAfterTitle', [
      'com_example.item', &amp;$item, &amp;$item-&gt;params, $offset,
    ]);
    
    $item-&gt;event-&gt;afterDisplayTitle = trim(implode("\n", $results));

    $results = $app-&gt;triggerEvent('onContentBeforeDisplay', [
      'com_example.item', &amp;$item, &amp;$item-&gt;params, $offset,
    ]);

    $item-&gt;event-&gt;beforeDisplayContent = trim(implode("\n", $results));

    $results = $app-&gt;triggerEvent('onContentAfterDisplay', [
      'com_example.item', &amp;$item, &amp;$item-&gt;params, $offset,
    ]);

    $item-&gt;event-&gt;afterDisplayContent = trim(implode("\n", $results));

    $this-&gt;item = $item;

    // ... your code here ...
  }
}</programlisting>

    <para>Your view template can then output <code>$this-&gt;event-&gt;afterDisplayTitle</code> etc in appropriate
    places.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>If you want to see how you can override Joomla's default custom field display to format it in a way that's
      more pleasant to the eye you can download Akeeba Ticket System Core (it's free of charge) and look at
      <classname>\Akeeba\Component\ATS\Site\View\Ticket\HtmlView</classname>.</para>

      <para>I have a method called <methodname>getCustomFieldsDisplay</methodname> which renders fields using custom
      layout overrides for the <literal>field.render</literal> and <literal>fields.render</literal> Joomla layouts.
      Ignore the section with the comment “Filter fields by ATS Private Display”, this is some special handling I use to
      make some fields invisible to the general public and only visible to the owner of the helpdesk ticket and the
      helpdesk personnel — this uses information from a custom plugin I ship with my software and is very specific to my
      use case.</para>

      <para>The two layout files (<filename>components/com_ats/layouts/field/render.php</filename> and
      <filename>components/com_ats/layouts/fields/render.php</filename>) are used to format the custom fields in a way
      which visually integrates more pleasantly than Joomla's default “word vomit” display style of nested unsorted
      lists.</para>

      <para>It goes without saying, my clients can of course choose to override these layout files OR the entire view
      template to render custom fields the way they see fit. For example, a site integrator might choose to have a
      custom field which is never displayed automatically, get its value using the field name and display it in a
      visually pleasant display in the view template. For instance, someone could have a custom field plugin which saves
      geographical coordinates. These could be displayed in the frontend of the site as an OpenStreetMap map. With
      custom fields, sky's the limit!</para>
